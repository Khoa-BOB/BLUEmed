# Broken toe

## Overview

A broken toe is a common injury that's most often caused by dropping something on a foot or stubbing a toe.

Usually, treating a broken toe involves taping it to the next toe. But if the fracture is severe — especially if it's in the big toe — proper healing might require a cast or even surgery to heal well.

Most broken toes heal well, usually within 4 to 6 weeks. Sometimes, however, a broken toe can get infected. Also, the break might increase the risk of getting osteoarthritis in that toe in the future.

## Symptoms

Signs and symptoms of a broken toe include:

- Pain
- Swelling
- Change in skin color from bruising or bleeding under the skin

### When to see a doctor

Consult a health care provider if the pain, swelling and change in skin color last for more than a few days or if the injury affects walking or wearing shoes.

## Causes

Dropping something heavy on a foot and stubbing the toe against something hard are the most common causes of a broken toe.

## Complications

Complications may include:

- Infection. If the skin is cut near the injured toe, the risk of getting an infection in the bone increases.
- Osteoarthritis. This wear-and-tear type of arthritis is more likely to occur when the break affects one of the toe joints.
