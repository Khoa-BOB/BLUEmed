# Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans

## Overview

Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare type of skin cancer. It starts in connective tissue cells in the middle layer of the skin (dermis).

Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans might look like a pimple or feel like a firm patch of skin at first. As it grows, lumps of tissue (protuberans) may form near the surface of the skin. This skin cancer often forms on the arms, legs and trunk.

Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans grows slowly and rarely spreads beyond the skin.

## Symptoms

Symptoms of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans include:

- A lump or lumps on the skin that look like pimples, scars or birthmarks.
- A lump or lumps on the skin that may feel hard to the touch or rubberlike.
- A patch of skin that feels firm to the touch.

The lumps typically appear on the arms, legs or trunk. They rarely form on the head or neck.

### When to see a doctor

Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have ongoing symptoms that worry you.

## Causes

The cause of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans often isn't known.

This skin cancer happens when cells in the skin develop changes. The changes happen in the cells' chromosomes. Chromosomes are threadlike structures inside cells that contain DNA and proteins. The changes in the chromosomes cause the cells to make many more cells quickly. The cancer cells form a growth that starts underneath the skin and may push up to create a lump over time. Other lumps may appear as well.

## Risk factors

Risk factors for dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans include:

- Age. This cancer can happen at any age. But it happens most often in adults ages 20 to 50.
- Race. This cancer happens more often in Black people than it does in people of other races.
- Prior skin injury. People with skin that has been burned, treated with radiation or scarred from surgery may be more likely to have this cancer.
- History of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. This cancer can come back locally after surgical removal.

There is no way to prevent dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.
