# Indigestion

## Overview

Indigestion is discomfort or pain in the belly. Symptoms may include a burning pain, feeling full while eating or feeling full long after eating. Indigestion symptoms may happen once in a while or often.

Indigestion may be caused by a digestive system condition. But often, there is no clear underlying cause. Frequent or long-lasting indigestion often can be treated with changes in diet and lifestyle, mental health therapy, and medicines.

Indigestion also is called upset stomach or dyspepsia.

## Symptoms

Symptoms of indigestion may include:

- Early fullness during a meal or not being able to finish a typical meal.
- Uncomfortable fullness that lasts longer than it should after a meal.
- Mild to severe pain in the upper abdomen, which is the area between the bottom of your breastbone and your belly button.
- Burning sensation in the upper abdomen.
- Bloating that feels like swelling or tightness in the upper abdomen.
- Feeling the need to vomit or vomiting.
- Burping or burping up food.

Sometimes people with indigestion also experience heartburn. Heartburn is a pain or burning feeling in the center of your chest during or after eating. The pain or burning feeling may radiate into your neck or back.

### When to see a doctor

Mild indigestion usually is nothing to worry about. Talk with your healthcare professional if symptoms of indigestion last more than two weeks.

Get care as soon as possible if you have indigestion and these symptoms:

- Severe or constant belly pain.
- Unintended weight loss or loss of appetite.
- Repeated vomiting or vomiting with blood.
- Black, tarry stools.
- Trouble with swallowing.
- Fatigue or weakness.
- A yellowing of the skin or eyes, also called jaundice.

Get emergency care if you have indigestion-like symptoms that may be symptoms of a heart attack:

- Shortness of breath, sweating, or chest pain radiating to the jaw, neck or arm.
- Chest pain when you're active or stressed.

## Causes

Indigestion usually has no clear underlying medical condition as a cause. Long-lasting or frequent indigestion with no clear underlying medical cause is called functional indigestion.

Many factors may contribute to or worsen functional indigestion. These include:

- Overeating or eating too quickly.
- Fatty, greasy or spicy foods.
- Caffeine, alcohol or carbonated beverages.
- Acidic foods, such as tomatoes and oranges.
- Anxiety, depression or trauma.
- Smoking.
- Certain antibiotics and pain relievers.

H. pylori bacteria can cause ulcers in the stomach or small intestine. H. pylori may contribute to indigestion even if it has not caused an ulcer.

### Underlying causes

Several conditions can cause indigestion. Underlying causes vary among different age groups.

- Children H. pylori infection. Other infections of the digestive system. Conditions affecting how much food the stomach can hold or how it empties. Stress.
- Young adults H. pylori infection. Gastroesophageal reflux disease, also called GERD, when stomach acid regularly flows back up into the esophagus. Diet. Stress.
- Adults ages 40 to 60 H. pylori infection. Ulcers of the stomach or small intestine. GERD. Pain medicines, such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve).
