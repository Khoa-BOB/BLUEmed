# B-cell lymphoma

## Overview

B-cell lymphomas are a type of lymphoma. Lymphoma is cancer that affects the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is made up of organs, glands, tubelike vessels and clusters of cells called lymph nodes. It's part of the body's germ-fighting immune system. B-cell lymphomas can affect lymph nodes, blood, bone marrow, and other tissues throughout the body, such as in the gastrointestinal system, central nervous system, bones or skin.

There are many types of lymphoma. They are often divided into two categories: Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. B-cell lymphomas are a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. There are many subtypes of B-cell lymphoma.

B-cell lymphomas get their names from the kind of cell that makes up these cancers. These cancers start in germ-fighting white blood cells called B cells. B cells also are called B lymphocytes.

Treatment for B-cell lymphomas may include a "watch and wait" approach, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, clinical trials, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy, and bone marrow transplant, also called bone marrow stem cell transplant.

### Types

There are many types of B-cell lymphoma, including:

- Burkitt lymphoma . This type is very aggressive but can be highly treatable if therapy begins right away. It may be found in the lymph nodes, bone marrow, gastrointestinal system, jaw or other bones in the face.
- Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma . This type grows slowly and may not need treatment right away. It may be found while testing for other conditions. It's usually found in the blood and bone marrow. Small lymphocytic lymphoma involves lymph nodes.
- Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma . This is the most common B-cell lymphoma. It grows quickly and needs to be treated right away for the best prognosis. It may be found in the lymph nodes, bone marrow, gastrointestinal system, central nervous system, bones or skin.
- Follicular lymphoma . This type grows slowly and may not need treatment right away. However, it also can become more aggressive over time. It's usually found in the lymph nodes, bone marrow or spleen.
- Mantle cell lymphoma . This type typically grows quickly but may act as a slow- or fast-growing lymphoma. It can be found in the lymph nodes, bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract and, sometimes, the spleen.
- Marginal zone lymphoma. This type is slow-growing and may not need treatment right away. It has three subtypes that tell where the cancer is in the body. Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (MALT lymphoma) is found outside of the lymph nodes, most commonly in the stomach. Nodal marginal zone lymphoma is found in the lymph nodes. And splenic marginal zone lymphoma affects the spleen and sometimes the blood and bone marrow.
- Primary central nervous system lymphoma. This rare type grows quickly. It involves the brain, spinal cord and, sometimes, tissues around the spinal cord. It also may affect the eyes, known as primary intraocular lymphoma.
- Primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma . This rare type affects the skin. It can cause lumps or hard patches of skin.
- Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma. This rare type grows quickly. It starts in the chest and can cause a mass that leads to trouble breathing or swelling in the face and neck.
- Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia . Also known as lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, this type grows slowly and may not cause symptoms for years. It may not need treatment right away. Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is mainly found in the bone marrow, lymph nodes and spleen.

Healthcare professionals may describe B-cell lymphomas as either aggressive or indolent. Aggressive lymphomas grow quickly and may have more symptoms. Indolent lymphomas grow slowly and may not have symptoms at first. Treatments may vary depending on whether the lymphoma is aggressive or indolent. Some indolent lymphomas can change into aggressive lymphomas.

## Symptoms

Symptoms of B-cell lymphomas vary depending on the type you have and what part of the body it affects. You may not have symptoms. When they happen, symptoms of B-cell lymphomas include:

- Swollen lymph nodes in the neck, armpit and groin.
- Fever.
- Drenching night sweats.
- Fatigue.
- Weight loss without trying.
- Loss of appetite.

### When to see a doctor

Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have any symptoms that worry you.

## Causes

It's not clear what causes B-cell lymphomas. Cancer happens when cells develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells.

B-cell lymphomas get their names from the kind of cell that makes up these cancers. These cancers start in germ-fighting white blood cells called B cells. B cells also are called B lymphocytes.

## Risk factors

Factors that can increase the risk of B-cell lymphomas include:

- A family history of lymphoma. Having a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, with lymphoma may increase your risk of B-cell lymphomas.
- A weakened immune system or an autoimmune condition. Having a condition that affects the immune system can increase the risk of B-cell lymphomas. Conditions may include Hashimoto disease, Sjogren syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. The immune system also may be weakened after organ transplant.
- Some infections. Some infections have been linked to types of B-cell lymphoma. These infections include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Epstein-Barr virus, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), hepatitis C and others.

## Complications

Complications of B-cell lymphomas may include:

- Relapse. Even after successful treatment, B-cell lymphomas may come back. This is called a relapse. Sometimes the relapse happens years later. Some people may have multiple relapses.
- Transformation. Some types of slow-growing B-cell lymphomas can change into more aggressive types. These lymphomas often have a worse prognosis and need stronger treatments.
