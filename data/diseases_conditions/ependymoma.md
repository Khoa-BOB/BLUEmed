# Ependymoma

## Overview

Ependymoma is a growth of cells that forms in the brain or spinal cord. The cells form a mass called a tumor. Ependymoma begins in the ependymal cells. These cells line the passageways that carry cerebrospinal fluid. This fluid surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord.

There are different types of ependymomas. Some grow slowly and aren't considered cancerous. Noncancerous tumors also are called benign tumors. A benign ependymoma may grow to press on nearby tissue. Sometimes ependymomas grow more quickly and are considered cancerous. Cancerous tumors also are called malignant tumors. A malignant ependymoma may grow to invade and destroy nearby tissue. Cancerous cells can break away and spread within the brain or spinal cord.

Ependymoma can occur at any age, but most often happens in young children. Children with ependymoma may experience headaches and seizures. Ependymoma that occurs in adults is more likely to form in the spinal cord. It may cause weakness in the part of the body controlled by the nerves affected by the tumor.

Surgery is the primary treatment for ependymoma. For tumors that are growing quickly or for tumors that can't be removed completely with surgery, additional treatments may be recommended. These may include radiation therapy, radiosurgery, chemotherapy or targeted therapy.

## Symptoms

Ependymoma signs and symptoms may depend on where it happens. This tumor can form in the brain or spinal cord.

Symptoms of ependymoma in the brain include:

- Blurry vision.
- Confusion.
- Headaches.
- Irritability.
- Nausea.
- Seizures.
- Vomiting.

Symptoms of ependymoma in the spinal cord include:

- Bowel changes.
- Loss of balance.
- Pain in the neck or back.
- Trouble walking.
- Weakness in the legs.

### When to see a doctor

Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have any symptoms that worry you.

## Causes

It's not clear what causes ependymoma. This tumor starts as a growth of cells in the brain or spinal cord.

Ependymoma happens when cells in the brain or spinal cord develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In tumor cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the tumor cells to grow and multiply quickly. Tumor cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells.

## Risk factors

Factors that increase the risk of ependymoma include:

- Young age. Ependymoma can happen at any age. This cancer happens most often in children.
- Inherited syndromes. Some ependymomas are linked to genetic conditions passed down in families, such as with neurofibromatosis type 2 and Li-Fraumeni syndrome.
