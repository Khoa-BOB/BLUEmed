# Latex allergy

## Overview

Latex allergy is a reaction to certain proteins found in natural rubber latex, a product made from the rubber tree. If you have a latex allergy, your body mistakes latex for a harmful substance.

Latex allergy may cause itchy skin and hives or even anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a possibly life-threatening condition that can cause throat swelling and serious difficulty breathing. A healthcare professional can find out if you have a latex allergy or if you're at risk of developing a latex allergy.

Understanding latex allergy and knowing common sources of latex can help you prevent allergic reactions.

## Symptoms

If you're allergic to latex, you're likely to have symptoms after touching latex rubber products, such as gloves or balloons. You also can have symptoms if you breathe in latex particles that are released into the air when someone removes latex gloves.

Latex allergy symptoms range from mild to serious. A reaction depends on how sensitive you are to latex and the amount of latex you touch or inhale. Your reaction can become worse with each additional latex exposure.

### Mild symptoms

Mild latex allergy symptoms include:

- Itching.
- Skin redness.
- Hives or rash.

### More-serious symptoms

These include:

- Sneezing.
- Runny nose.
- Itchy, watery eyes.
- Scratchy throat.
- Difficulty breathing.
- Wheezing.
- Cough.

### Life-threatening symptoms: Anaphylaxis

The most serious allergic reaction to latex is anaphylaxis, which can be deadly. An anaphylactic (an-uh-fuh-LAK-tik) reaction develops immediately after latex exposure in highly sensitive people. However, it rarely happens the first time someone is exposed.

Symptoms of anaphylaxis include:

- Difficulty breathing.
- Hives or swelling.
- Nausea and vomiting.
- Wheezing.
- Drop in blood pressure.
- Dizziness.
- Loss of consciousness.
- Confusion.
- Rapid or weak pulse.

### When to see a doctor

Seek emergency medical care if you are having or think you're having an anaphylactic reaction.

If you have less severe reactions after exposure to latex, talk to a healthcare professional. If possible, see a care professional when you're reacting. This will help with diagnosis.

## Causes

In a latex allergy, the immune system identifies latex as a harmful substance and triggers certain antibodies to fight it off. The next time there is a latex exposure, these antibodies tell the immune system to release histamine and other chemicals into the bloodstream. This process produces a range of allergy symptoms. The more times someone is exposed to latex, the more strongly their immune system is likely to respond. This is called sensitization.

Latex allergy can happen in these ways:

- Direct contact. The most common cause of latex allergy involves touching latex-containing products, including latex gloves, condoms and balloons.
- Inhalation. Latex products, especially gloves, release latex particles. You can breathe in these particles when they become airborne. The amount of airborne latex from gloves differs greatly depending on the brand of glove used.

It's possible to have other skin reactions when using latex. They include:

- Allergic contact dermatitis. This reaction results from the chemical additives used during manufacturing. The main symptom is a skin rash with formation of blisters 24 to 48 hours after exposure, similar to poison ivy.
- Irritant contact dermatitis. Not an allergy, this skin irritation is caused by wearing rubber gloves or exposure to the powder inside them. Symptoms include dry, itchy, irritated areas, usually on the hands.

Not all latex products are made from natural sources. Products containing synthetic materials, such as latex paint, are unlikely to cause a reaction.

## Risk factors

Certain people are at greater risk of developing a latex allergy:

- People with spina bifida. The risk of latex allergy is highest in people with spina bifida — a birth defect that affects the development of the spine. People with this disorder often are exposed to latex products through early and frequent healthcare. People with spina bifida should always avoid latex products.
- People who undergo multiple surgeries or medical procedures. Repeated exposure to latex gloves and medical products increases your risk of developing latex allergy.
- Healthcare workers. If you work in healthcare, you're at increased risk of developing a latex allergy.
- Rubber industry workers. Repeated exposure to latex may increase sensitivity.
- People with a personal or family history of allergies. You're at increased risk of latex allergy if you have other allergies — such as hay fever or a food allergy — or they're common in your family.

### Connection between food allergy and latex allergy

Certain fruits contain the same allergens found in latex. They include:

- Avocado.
- Banana.
- Chestnut.
- Kiwi.
- Passion fruit.

If you're allergic to latex, you have a greater chance of also being allergic to these foods.
