# Meralgia paresthetica

## Overview

Meralgia paresthetica is a condition that causes tingling, numbness and burning pain in the outer thigh. It's caused by compression of the nerve that provides feeling to the skin covering the thigh. Meralgia paresthetica also is known as lateral femoral cutaneous nerve entrapment.

Tight clothing, obesity or weight gain, and pregnancy are common causes of meralgia paresthetica. But meralgia paresthetica also can be due to an injury or a disease such as diabetes.

Meralgia paresthetica often can be relieved with conservative measures, including wearing looser clothing. If symptoms aren't relieved by those measures, treatment may include medicines. Rarely, surgery is needed.

## Symptoms

Meralgia paresthetica may cause these symptoms in the outer part of the thigh:

- Tingling.
- Burning pain.
- Decreased feeling or numbness.
- Increased sensitivity and pain to even a light touch.

These symptoms commonly occur on one side of your body and might intensify after walking or standing.

### When to see your doctor

See your healthcare professional if you have symptoms of meralgia paresthetica.

## Causes

Meralgia paresthetica occurs when the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is pinched, also known as compression. The nerve supplies feeling to the surface of the outer thigh. The nerve only affects sensation and doesn't impact your ability to use your leg muscles.

In most people, this nerve passes through the groin to the upper thigh without trouble. But in meralgia paresthetica, the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve becomes trapped. Often the inguinal ligament pinches the nerve. This ligament runs along the groin from the stomach to the upper thigh.

Common causes of this compression include any condition that increases pressure on the groin, including:

- Tight clothing, such as belts, corsets and tight pants.
- Obesity or weight gain.
- Wearing a heavy tool belt.
- Pregnancy.
- Fluid accumulation in the abdomen causing increased abdominal pressure.
- Scar tissue near the inguinal ligament due to injury or past surgery.

Nerve injury also can cause meralgia paresthetica. Nerve injury can be due to diabetes, trauma after surgery or seat belt injury after a motor vehicle accident.

## Risk factors

The following might increase your risk of meralgia paresthetica:

- Extra weight. Being overweight or obese can increase the pressure on your lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.
- Pregnancy. A growing belly puts added pressure on your groin, through which the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve passes.
- Diabetes. Diabetes-related nerve injury can lead to meralgia paresthetica.
- Age. People between ages 30 and 60 are at a higher risk.
