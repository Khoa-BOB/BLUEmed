# Dysarthria

## Overview

Dysarthria happens when the muscles used for speech are weak or are hard to control. Dysarthria often causes slurred or slow speech that can be difficult to understand.

Common causes of dysarthria include conditions that affect the nervous system or that cause facial paralysis. These conditions may cause tongue or throat muscle weakness. Certain medicines also can cause dysarthria.

Treating the underlying cause of dysarthria may improve your speech. You also may need speech therapy. For dysarthria caused by prescription medicines, changing or stopping the medicines may help.
