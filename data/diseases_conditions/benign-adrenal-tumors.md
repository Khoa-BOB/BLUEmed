# Benign adrenal tumors

## Overview

Benign adrenal tumors are masses that aren't cancer. They form in the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are part of the endocrine system. These glands make hormones that send messages to nearly every organ and tissue in the body.

There are two adrenal glands, one above each kidney. Each gland has two types of tissue: the cortex and the medulla. Benign adrenal tumors that grow in the cortex are called adrenal adenomas. Those that grow in the medulla are called pheochromocytomas (fee-o-kroe-moe-sy-TOE-muhs).

Most benign adrenal tumors cause no symptoms and don't need treatment. But sometimes these tumors make high levels of some hormones that can cause problems. Hormones from the cortex control metabolism, blood pressure and certain body features, such as hair growth. Hormones from the medulla control the body's response to stress.

## Symptoms

Symptoms depend on whether the tumor makes hormones, what hormone it makes and how much it makes. But many benign adrenal gland tumors don't cause symptoms because they don't make hormones.

The most common type of benign adrenal tumor, called adenoma, comes from the adrenal cortex. This type of tumor might cause symptoms such as:

- Weight gain.
- Easy bruising.
- High blood pressure, also called hypertension.
- Diabetes.
- Depressed mood.
- Tiredness.
- Muscle weakness or cramping.

A type of benign adrenal tumor from the medulla is called pheochromocytoma. It might cause the following symptoms:

- High blood pressure, also called hypertension.
- Fast heartbeat.
- Sweating.
- Tremors.
- Headache.

## Causes

The cause of benign adrenal tumors often is not known.

## Risk factors

The following might raise the risk of developing a benign adrenal tumor:

- A family history of benign adrenal tumors.
- Certain syndromes passed through families, called genetic syndromes, that make benign adrenal tumors more likely.
- A history of having an adrenal tumor surgically removed.
