# Sclerosing mesenteritis

## Overview

Sclerosing mesenteritis is a condition in which tissue that holds the small intestines in place, called the mesentery, becomes inflamed and forms scar tissue. The condition also is called mesenteric panniculitis. Sclerosing mesenteritis is rare, and it's not clear what causes it.

Sclerosing mesenteritis can cause belly pain, vomiting, bloating, diarrhea and fever. But some people experience no symptoms and may never need treatment.

In rare cases, scar tissue formed by sclerosing mesenteritis can block food from moving through the digestive tract. In this case, you may need surgery.
