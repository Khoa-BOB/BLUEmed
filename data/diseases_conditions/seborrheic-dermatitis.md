# Seborrheic dermatitis

## Overview

Seborrheic (seb-o-REE-ik) dermatitis is a common skin condition that mainly affects your scalp. It causes scaly patches, inflamed skin and stubborn dandruff. It usually affects oily areas of the body, such as the face, sides of the nose, eyebrows, ears, eyelids and chest. This condition can be irritating but it's not contagious, and it doesn't cause permanent hair loss.

Seborrheic dermatitis may go away without treatment. Or you may need to use medicated shampoo or other products long term to clear up symptoms and prevent flare-ups.

Seborrheic dermatitis is also called dandruff, seborrheic eczema and seborrheic psoriasis. When it occurs in infants, it's called cradle cap.

## Symptoms

Seborrheic dermatitis signs and symptoms may include:

- Flaking skin (dandruff) on your scalp, hair, eyebrows, beard or mustache
- Patches of greasy skin covered with flaky white or yellow scales or crust on the scalp, face, sides of the nose, eyebrows, ears, eyelids, chest, armpits, groin area or under the breasts
- Rash that may look darker or lighter in people with brown or Black skin and redder in those with white skin
- Ring-shaped (annular) rash, for a type called petaloid seborrheic dermatitis
- Itchiness (pruritus)

The signs and symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis tend to flare with stress, fatigue or a change of season.
