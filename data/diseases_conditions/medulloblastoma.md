# Medulloblastoma

## Overview

Medulloblastoma (muh-dul-o-blas-TOE-muh) is a cancerous brain tumor that starts in the lower back part of the brain. This part of the brain is called the cerebellum. It is involved in muscle coordination, balance and movement.

Medulloblastoma begins as a growth of cells, which is called a tumor. The cells grow quickly and can spread to other parts of the brain. Medulloblastoma cells tend to spread through the fluid that surrounds and protects your brain and spinal cord. This is called cerebrospinal fluid. Medulloblastomas don't usually spread to other parts of the body.

Medulloblastoma can happen at any age, but most often occurs in young children. Though medulloblastoma is rare, it's the most common cancerous brain tumor in children. Medulloblastoma happens more often in families that have a history of conditions that increase the risk of cancer. These syndromes include Gorlin syndrome or Turcot syndrome.

## Symptoms

Medulloblastoma symptoms happen when the cancer grows or causes pressure to build up in the brain. Signs and symptoms of medulloblastoma may include:

- Dizziness.
- Double vision.
- Headaches.
- Nausea.
- Poor coordination.
- Tiredness.
- Unsteady walk.
- Vomiting.

### When to see a doctor

Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have any symptoms that worry you.

## Causes

It's not clear what causes medulloblastoma. This cancer starts as a growth of cells in the brain.

Medulloblastoma happens when cells in the brain develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to grow and multiply quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells.

The cancer cells form a mass called a tumor that can grow to push on nearby structures. The cancer cells can invade and destroy healthy body tissue. They also can spread to other areas.

## Risk factors

Factors that may increase the risk of medulloblastoma include:

- Young age. Medulloblastoma can happen at any age. This cancer happens most often in children.
- Inherited syndromes. Medulloblastoma happens more often in families that have a history of conditions that increase the risk of cancer. These conditions include Fanconi anemia, Gorlin syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome and Turcot syndrome.
