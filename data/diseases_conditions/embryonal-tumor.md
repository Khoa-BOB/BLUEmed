# Embryonal tumors

## Overview

Embryonal tumors are growths of cells that happen in the brain. The growths involve cells that are left over from fetal development, called embryonal cells.

Embryonal tumors are a type of brain cancer, also called malignant brain tumor. This means the cells that make up the tumor can grow to invade the brain and cause damage to healthy brain tissue. They also can spread through the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, called cerebrospinal fluid.

Embryonal tumors most often happen in babies and young children. But they can happen at any age.

There are several kinds of embryonal tumors. The most common is medulloblastoma. This type of embryonal tumor starts in the lower back part of the brain, called the cerebellum.

If your child is diagnosed with an embryonal tumor, seek care at a medical center that has experience caring for children with brain tumors. Medical centers with expertise in pediatric brain tumors provide access to the latest treatments and technology to ensure proper diagnosis and treatment.

## Symptoms

Symptoms of an embryonal tumor may include:

- Headaches.
- Nausea.
- Vomiting.
- Feeling more tired than usual.
- Double vision.
- Difficulty with balance.
- Seizures.

### When to see a doctor

Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have any symptoms that worry you.

## Causes

The cause of an embryonal tumor often isn't known. This cancer causes a growth of cells in the brain. The growth involves cells that are left over from fetal development, called embryonal cells.

Embryonal tumors start when embryonal cells develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to grow and multiply quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells.

The cancer cells might form a mass called a tumor. The tumor can grow and press on parts of the brain. The cancer cells also can travel in the fluid that supports the brain and spine. This can spread the cancer to other parts of the brain and spinal cord. When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer.

## Risk factors

Risk factors for embryonal tumors include:

- Young age. This cancer can happen at any age. But it happens most often in children.
- Hereditary syndromes. Some conditions that run in families can raise the risk of embryonal tumor. Examples include Fanconi anemia, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome and Turcot syndrome.
