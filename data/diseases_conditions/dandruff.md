# Dandruff

## Overview

Dandruff is a common condition that causes small pieces of dry skin to flake from the scalp. It isn't contagious or harmful. But it can be embarrassing and difficult to treat.

You can treat mild dandruff with gentle, regular shampooing. If that doesn't help, you may need to use a special medicated shampoo.

There is no cure for dandruff. Even if you treat it, the symptoms may come back later. But with treatment, most people can manage the symptoms.

Dandruff is a mild form of seborrheic dermatitis, a skin condition that mainly affects your scalp.

## Symptoms

Dandruff symptoms may include:

- Skin flakes on your scalp, hair, eyebrows or shoulders.
- Itchy scalp.
- Scaly, crusty scalp in infants. This also is called cradle cap.

Dandruff may get worse when you're stressed or during cold, dry weather.

### When to see a doctor

Dandruff usually doesn't need medical treatment. But if it doesn't get better with regular use of dandruff shampoo, see your healthcare professional.

## Causes

Dandruff may have several causes, including:

- Irritated, oily skin.
- Dry skin.
- A type of fungus called malassezia that lives on the scalps of most adults and feeds on natural oils.
- Sensitivity to hair care products. This is called contact dermatitis.
- Other skin conditions, such as psoriasis and eczema.

## Risk factors

Almost anyone can have dandruff. Some factors can make you more likely to have it:

- Age. Dandruff often starts in young adulthood and lasts through middle age. But older adults can have it too. For some people, it never goes away.
- Sex assigned at birth. Dandruff is more common in males.
- Certain illnesses. Conditions that affect the nervous system, such as Parkinson's disease, increase the risk of getting dandruff. Having HIV or a weakened immune system also can make dandruff more likely.
