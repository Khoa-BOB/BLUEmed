# Aortic aneurysm

## Overview

An aortic aneurysm is a bulge that occurs in the wall of the body's main artery, called the aorta. The aorta carries blood from the heart to the body. Aortic aneurysms can occur anywhere in the aorta. They may be tube shaped or round.

Aortic aneurysms include:

- Abdominal aortic aneurysm . This type occurs along the part of the aorta that passes through the belly area.
- Thoracic aortic aneurysm . This type occurs along the part of the aorta that passes through the chest cavity.

Some people may have both types of aortic aneurysms.

An aortic aneurysm increases the risk of a tear in the inner layer of the wall of the aorta. This tear is called an aortic dissection .
