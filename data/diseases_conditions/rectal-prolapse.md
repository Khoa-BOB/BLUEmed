# Rectal prolapse

## Overview

Rectal prolapse happens when the rectum slips out of the anus and can be seen outside the body. While rectal prolapse may cause pain, it's rarely a medical emergency.

Rectal prolapse is sometimes treated with stool softeners, suppositories and other medicines. But surgery is usually needed to treat rectal prolapse.

## Symptoms

If you have rectal prolapse, you may notice a reddish lump that comes out of the anus, often while straining during a bowel movement. The lump may slip back inside the anus, or it may continue to be seen.

Other symptoms may include:

- You cannot control your bowel movements, known as fecal incontinence.
- Constipation or loose stools.
- Leaking blood or mucus from the rectum.
- Feeling that your rectum isn't empty after a bowel movement.

## Causes

The cause of rectal prolapse is unclear. Though it's a common belief that rectal prolapse is related to childbirth, about one-third of women with this health problem never had children.

## Risk factors

Some things may increase your risk of getting rectal prolapse, including:

- Sex. Most people with rectal prolapse are women.
- Age. Rectal prolapse most often happens in people over age 50.
- Constipation. Straining may increase the risk of rectal prolapse.
