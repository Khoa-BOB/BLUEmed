# Pediatric white blood cell disorders

## Overview

Children with pediatric white blood cell disorders have too few or too many white blood cells. White blood cells, called leukocytes, are part of the immune system. They come from bone marrow and help fight infections. Several conditions can cause having too few or too many white blood cells.

A low white blood cell count, also called leukopenia, means having too few leukocytes in the blood. A long-term low white blood cell count raises the risk of infections.

A high white blood cell count, also called leukocytosis, means having too many leukocytes in the blood. This most often is from an infection.

### Types

There are several types of white blood cells. Each has its own disease-fighting activity. These are the main types:

- Neutrophils. More than half the body's white blood cells are neutrophils. Having too few neutrophils is called neutropenia (noo-troe-PEE-nee-uh). Neutrophils fight infections caused by bacteria or fungi.
- Lymphocytes. Too few lymphocytes causes lymphocytopenia (lim-foe-sie-toe-PEE-nee-uh). Lymphocytes, also called T cells and B cells, mainly protect against viral infections.
- Monocytes. These white cells help rid the body of dead or damaged tissue. And they help the body's immune response.
- Eosinophils. Eosinophilia (e-o-sin-o-FIL-e-uh) is a having too many eosinophil cells. These cells help with swelling and irritation, called inflammation. They also help with parasites and allergies.
- Basophils. This is the least common type of white blood cell. Basophils have a role in wound healing, asthma and allergic reactions.

## Symptoms

Symptoms depend on the type of white blood cell and whether there are too few or too many of them. Symptoms might be those of infections, conditions in which the immune system attacks healthy tissues, called autoimmune conditions, allergies and certain cancers.

## Causes

The cause of pediatric white blood cell disorders depends on the type of white blood cell that's affected.

### Neutropenia

Cancer and conditions that damage bone marrow can cause this low neutrophil count. Certain medicines, infections and other conditions also can cause neutropenia.

### Lymphocytopenia

Syndromes passed through families, known as inherited syndromes, can cause too few lymphocytes. Lymphocytopenia also is linked with infections, cancer and conditions in which the body attacks its own tissue, called autoimmune conditions. And it can be a side effect of some medicines or other treatments.

### Monocyte disorders

Infections, cancer, autoimmune diseases and other conditions can cause a rise in the number of monocytes. Toxins, chemotherapy and other causes can result in too few monocytes.

### Eosinophilia

Allergic reactions, skin conditions or infections with parasites are the most common causes of having too many eosinophil cells.

### Basophilic disorders

Allergic reactions or infections can lower the number of basophils. Certain types of blood cancer and other conditions can raise the number of basophils.

## Risk factors

The following factors can raise the risk of pediatric white blood cell disorders:

- Family history.
- Infections.
- Cancer.
- Allergies.
- Conditions in which the body attacks its own cells, called autoimmune conditions.
- Certain medicines.
