# Functional dyspepsia

## Overview

Functional dyspepsia is a term used to describe a lingering upset stomach that has no obvious cause. Functional dyspepsia (dis-PEP-see-uh) also is called nonulcer dyspepsia.

Functional dyspepsia is common. It is a constant condition, but symptoms don't happen all the time. Symptoms are like those of an ulcer. They include pain or discomfort in the upper belly, bloating, belching and nausea.

## Symptoms

Symptoms of functional dyspepsia may include:

- Pain or burning in the stomach, bloating, excessive belching or nausea after eating.
- An early feeling of fullness when eating. The feeling of fullness also is called satiety.
- Stomach pain that happens unrelated to meals or goes away when eating.

### When to see a doctor

Make an appointment with a healthcare professional if you experience constant symptoms that worry you.

Seek medical attention right away if you experience:

- Bloody vomit.
- Dark, tarry stools.
- Shortness of breath.
- Pain in your jaw, neck or arm.
- Unexplained weight loss.

## Causes

No one knows what causes functional dyspepsia. Medical professionals consider it a functional disorder. That means it can't be explained by a medical condition, so routine testing may not show any problems or causes. As a result, the diagnosis is based on symptoms.

## Risk factors

Some factors can increase the risk of functional dyspepsia. They include:

- Being female.
- Using certain pain relievers that are available without a prescription. These include aspirin and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), which can cause stomach problems.
- Smoking.
- Anxiety or depression.
- History of childhood physical or sexual abuse.
- Helicobacter pylori infection.
