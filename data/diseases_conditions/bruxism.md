# Teeth grinding (bruxism)

## Overview

The medical term for teeth grinding is bruxism (BRUK-siz-um), a condition in which you squeeze or rub your teeth together, also called clenching or grinding. Bruxism is common and can happen during the day or night. If you have awake bruxism, you clench or grind your teeth when you're awake without being aware that you're doing it. If you have sleep bruxism, you clench or grind your teeth during sleep. Sleep bruxism is a sleep-related movement disorder.

People who clench or grind their teeth during sleep are more likely to have other sleep disorders, such as snoring and pauses in breathing called sleep apnea. Some people may not know they have sleep bruxism until they have tooth or jaw problems because of it.

In some people, bruxism can be a problem and happen often enough to lead to jaw pain, headaches, damaged teeth and other problems. The grinding sound can disrupt a bed partner's sleep. Learn the symptoms of bruxism and get regular dental care to check your teeth.

## Symptoms

Symptoms of bruxism may include:

- Teeth grinding or clenching, which may be loud enough to wake up your sleep partner.
- Teeth that are flattened, fractured, chipped or loose.
- Worn tooth enamel. This can expose the inner layers of your teeth.
- Tooth pain or sensitivity.
- Tired or tight jaw muscles, or a locked jaw that won't open or close all the way. Your jaw may pop and click.
- Jaw, neck or face pain or soreness.
- Jaw muscles that are larger than expected.
- Pain that feels like an earache, though it's not really a problem with your ear.
- Dull headache starting at your temples — the sides of your head between your forehead and ears.
- Sleep problems.

### When to see a doctor

See your dentist or other healthcare professional if you have symptoms that could be caused by grinding or clenching your teeth or if you have other concerns about your teeth or jaws.

If you notice that your child has symptoms of teeth grinding, be sure to mention it at your child's next dental appointment.

## Causes

Exactly what causes bruxism isn't completely understood. It may be due to a mix of physical, mental health and genetic factors.

- Awake bruxism may be due to emotions such as anxiety, stress, anger, frustration or tension. Bruxism also may be a coping strategy or a habit when you're thinking deeply or concentrating.
- Sleep bruxism may be a sleep-related chewing activity linked with brief disturbances during sleep.

## Risk factors

These factors can raise your risk of bruxism:

- Stress. Having extra anxiety or stress can lead to teeth grinding and clenching. So can anger and frustration.
- Age. Bruxism is common in young children, but it usually goes away by adulthood.
- Personality type. Having a personality type that's aggressive, competitive or hyperactive can raise your risk of bruxism.
- Awake time mouth habits. Mouth habits, such as lip, tongue or cheek biting and chewing gum for long periods of time, can increase the risk of awake bruxism.
- Medicines and other substances. Smoking tobacco or drinking caffeinated beverages or alcohol can raise your risk of bruxism. So can using recreational drugs or taking medicines that aren't approved by your healthcare professional. It's not common, but bruxism can be a side effect of mental health medicines such as some antidepressants and medicines to treat seizures and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
- Family members with bruxism. Sleep bruxism tends to occur in families. If you have bruxism, other members of your family also may have bruxism or a history of it.
- Other conditions. Bruxism can be linked with some mental health and medical conditions. These may include Parkinson's disease, dementia, gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD), epilepsy, night terrors, sleep-related disorders such as sleep apnea and ADHD.

## Complications

For most people bruxism doesn't cause serious complications. But severe bruxism may lead to:

- Damage to your teeth or jaws and to fillings, crowns or other dental repairs.
- Tension-type headaches.
- Severe facial or jaw pain.
- Conditions that occur in the temporomandibular joints (TMJs). These are jaw joints just in front of your ears. TMJ problems can cause pain and may sound like clicking when you open and close your mouth.
