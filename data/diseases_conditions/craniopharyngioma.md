# Craniopharyngioma

## Overview

Craniopharyngioma is a rare type of noncancerous brain tumor.

Craniopharyngioma begins as a growth of cells near the brain's pituitary gland. The pituitary gland makes hormones that control many body functions. As a craniopharyngioma slowly grows, it can affect the pituitary gland and other nearby structures in the brain.

Craniopharyngioma can happen at any age, but it occurs most often in children and older adults. Symptoms include changes in vision over time, fatigue, headaches and urinating more often. Children with craniopharyngioma may grow slowly and may be smaller than expected.

## Symptoms

Signs and symptoms of craniopharyngioma may include:

- Headaches.
- Vision changes.
- Nausea and vomiting.
- Increased urination.
- Sleepiness.
- Memory troubles.
- Loss of balance.
- Trouble walking.
- Changes in personality or behavior.
- Weight gain and slowed growth in children.

### When to see a doctor

Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have any symptoms that worry you.

## Causes

It's not clear what causes craniopharyngioma. Craniopharyngioma begins as a growth of cells near the brain's pituitary gland. The pituitary gland makes hormones that control many body functions.

Craniopharyngioma happens when cells develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In tumor cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the tumor cells to grow and multiply quickly. Tumor cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells.

## Risk factors

Healthcare professionals haven't found many risk factors for craniopharyngioma. This tumor can happen at any age. But it's more common in children and older adults.
