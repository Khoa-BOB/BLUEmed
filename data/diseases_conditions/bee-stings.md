# Bee sting

## Overview

A bee sting is a common outdoor nuisance. You can take several steps to avoid stings from bees, hornets and wasps. If you're stung, basic first aid can help ease the pain of a mild or moderate reaction. You may need emergency medical help for a severe reaction.

## Symptoms

Bee sting symptoms can range from pain and swelling to a life-threatening allergic reaction. Having one type of reaction doesn't mean you'll always have the same reaction every time you're stung or that the next reaction will be more severe.

- Mild reaction. Most of the time, bee sting symptoms are minor and include instant, sharp burning pain, a welt and swelling. In most people, the swelling and pain go away within a few hours.
- Moderate reaction. Some people who get stung by a bee or other insect have a stronger reaction, with burning pain, a welt, itching, flushing and swelling that gets worse over the next day or two. The symptoms can last up to seven days.
- Severe reaction. A severe reaction to a bee sting is potentially life-threatening and requires emergency treatment. This type of reaction is called anaphylaxis. A small percentage of people who are stung by a bee or other insect develop anaphylaxis. It usually happens 15 minutes to an hour after the sting. Symptoms include rash, itching, trouble breathing, swollen tongue, trouble swallowing and tightness in the chest.
- Multiple bee stings. If you get stung more than a dozen times, you can have a bad reaction that makes you feel quite sick. Symptoms include those of a moderate reaction as well as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever and lightheadedness.

### When to see a doctor

Call 911 or seek immediate care for:

- A severe reaction to a bee sting that suggests anaphylaxis, even if it's just one or two symptoms. If you were prescribed emergency epinephrine that you inject yourself (EpiPen, Auvi-Q, others), use it right away as your healthcare professional directed. Inject the epinephrine first, then call 911.
- Multiple stings in children, older adults, and people who have heart or breathing problems.

Make an appointment to see a healthcare professional if:

- Bee sting symptoms don't go away within three days.
- You've had other symptoms of an allergic response to a bee sting.

## Causes

A bee sting is an injury caused by bee venom. To sting, a bee jabs a barbed stinger into the skin. The stinger releases venom. The venom has proteins in it that cause pain and swelling around the sting area.

Generally, insects such as bees and wasps aren't aggressive and only sting in self-defense. In most cases, this results in one or perhaps a few stings. Some types of bees tend to swarm, stinging in a group. An example of this type of bee is Africanized bees.

## Risk factors

Risk factors for a bee sting include:

- Living in an area where bees are active.
- Being near beehives.
- Spending a lot of time outdoors.

## Prevention

The following tips may help reduce your risk of a bee sting:

- Take care when drinking sweet beverages outside. Use wide, open cups so you can see if a bee is in them. Inspect cans and straws before drinking from them.
- Tightly cover food containers and trash cans, as odors from them can attract insects.
- Clear away garbage, fallen fruit, and dog or other animal feces, as flies can attract wasps.
- Wear closed-toe shoes when walking outside. Don't walk through flowers.
- Don't use perfumes and scented hair and body products, as they can attract insects.
- Don't wear bright colors or floral prints, as they can attract bees.
- Be careful when mowing the lawn or trimming vegetation. Such activities might disturb insects in a beehive or wasp nest.
- Avoid being near bees, yellow jackets and hornets. For example, remove hives and nests near your home if you can do this safely.

Know what to do when bees or other stinging insects are nearby:

- If a few bees are flying around you, stay calm and slowly walk away from the area. Swatting at an insect may cause it to sting.
- If a bee or wasp stings you, or many insects start to fly around, cover your mouth and nose and quickly leave the area. When a bee stings, it releases a chemical that attracts other bees. If you can, get into a building or closed vehicle.

People who have a severe reaction to a bee sting have on average a 50% chance of anaphylaxis the next time they're stung. Talk to a healthcare professional about prevention measures such as allergy shots to avoid a similar reaction if you get stung again.
