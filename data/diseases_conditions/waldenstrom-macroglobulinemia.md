# Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia

## Overview

Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (mak-roe-glob-u-lih-NEE-me-uh) is a type of cancer that begins in the white blood cells. Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is considered a type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It's sometimes called lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.

In Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, some white blood cells undergo changes that turn them into cancer cells. The cancer cells can build up in the spongy material inside the bones where blood cells are made. This material is called bone marrow. The cancer cells crowd healthy blood cells out of the bone marrow. Cancer cells also may build up in other parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes and the spleen.

The cancer cells make a protein that can build up in the blood. Too much of the protein can reduce blood flow in the body and cause other problems.

## Symptoms

Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia grows slowly. It might not cause symptoms for years.

When they happen, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia symptoms may include:

- Fatigue.
- Fever.
- Weight loss.
- Night sweats.
- Numbness in the hands or feet.
- Swollen lymph nodes.
- A feeling of pain or fullness under the ribs on your left side, which may be caused by an enlarged spleen.
- Easy bruising.
- Bleeding nose or gums.
- Headache.
- Shortness of breath.
- Changes in vision.
- Confusion.

### When to see a doctor

Make an appointment with your primary care provider if you have ongoing symptoms that worry you.

## Causes

Cancer happens when cells develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The changes tell the cells to multiply quickly. The cells continue living when healthy cells would die as part of their natural lifecycle.

In Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, the changes happen in the white blood cells. The changes turn some of the white blood cells into cancer cells. It's not clear what causes the changes.

The cancer cells can build up in the spongy material inside the bones where blood cells are made. This material is called bone marrow. The cancer cells crowd healthy blood cells out of the bone marrow. The cancer cells also may build up in the lymph nodes and the spleen.

Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia cells make a protein that the body can't use. The protein is immunoglobulin M, which is also called IgM. IgM can build up in the blood. This may reduce blood flow in the body and cause other problems.

## Risk factors

Factors that can increase the risk of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia include:

- Being older. Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia can occur at any age, but it's most often found in adults 70 and older.
- Being male. Males are more likely to have Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.
- Being white. White people are more likely to develop the disease, compared with people of other races.
- Having a family history of lymphoma. Having a relative who has Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia or another type of B-cell lymphoma might increase your risk.
