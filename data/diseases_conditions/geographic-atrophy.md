# Geographic atrophy

## Overview

Geographic atrophy is a serious eye condition. It occurs in people with another eye condition called age-related macular degeneration. It is most common in people over age 60.

Over time, geographic atrophy can lead to loss of central vision, which helps you see what is in front of you. This happens when the light-sensing tissue at the back of the eye, called the retina, is damaged. The damaged retina can get larger over time, causing increasing vision loss.

Geographic atrophy can affect one or both eyes. There is no cure, but the FDA has approved some new therapies to slow down its progression. Other new treatments are being studied in clinical trials.

## Symptoms

People with geographic atrophy may notice changes in vision that start slowly and get worse over time. Geographic atrophy often starts just outside the center of the retina and slowly moves inward. As it grows, you can lose central vision or have blurred or blind spots.

Many people keep decent central vision early on, but as geographic atrophy spreads, this vision can be lost. Vision loss can become severe over time. It can make it hard to drive, read, watch TV and do household chores. People with geographic atrophy usually keep their side vision, known as peripheral vision.

### Common symptoms include:

- Fuzzy or blurry areas in your central vision.
- Trouble reading even with glasses.
- Needing brighter light to see details.
- Colors seeming less vivid.

### Rare or less common symptoms include:

- Sudden onset of central blind spots.
- Distortion of shapes, such as straight lines seeming bent.
- Rapid drops in vision.

### When to see a doctor

Geographic atrophy can develop quickly. See your eye doctor right away if you notice any of these changes:

- A sudden increase in blurry or distorted vision.
- New dark spots or blank areas in your vision.
- Flashes of light or floaters that seem to appear suddenly.

## Causes

Geographic atrophy is an eye condition that can occur in people with another eye condition called dry age-related macular degeneration. It causes gradual loss of vision in people, usually as they age. It affects parts of the retina, the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye.

The cause of geographic atrophy is not fully known. One main cause is damage to a layer of cells that support the retina. This is called the retinal pigment epithelium. The damage can happen because of natural aging or due to outside factors such as smoking.

Over time, this damage causes yellow deposits called drusen to form. These deposits are a sign of early retina damage. Drusen are made up of fats and pieces of cells. Drusen can make the immune system react, causing swelling. This leads to the death of important cells in the retina called photoreceptors. Photoreceptors help you see.

As these cells die, parts of the retina start to break down. This loss of cells and damage to the retina causes central vision to get blurry. It can lead to vision loss over time.

Currently, there is no cure for geographic atrophy. But scientists are researching ways to slow down the damage and help protect the retina from further harm.

## Risk factors

Some people have a higher chance of developing geographic atrophy. Risk factors include:

- Age: People over age 60 are more likely to have geographic atrophy.
- Genetics: Certain gene changes make some people more prone to the condition.
- Family history: If a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, has the eye condition macular degeneration, the risk of geographic atrophy is higher.
- Smoking: Current or past smoking can increase the risk.
- Other factors: Having high blood pressure or being overweight may play a role.

## Complications

Other eye conditions can develop with geographic atrophy, including:

- Further vision loss: As more areas of the retina are damaged, blind spots can grow in size.
- A more advanced form of macular degeneration: Some people with geographic atrophy develop leaking blood vessels under the retina, which can rapidly damage vision.
- Blindness: In later stages of geographic atrophy, vision may drop below the level needed for activities such as driving, reading or watching TV.
- Stress and depression: Loss of vision can lead to high stress levels and depression.

To help manage the condition, understand your risk factors and schedule regular eye exams. Ask your eye doctor how you can help preserve your independence and quality of life. If you notice sudden vision changes, especially blind spots or distorted lines, call your eye doctor right away. Work with your eye care professional team to find the best treatment for you.

## Prevention

There is no sure way to prevent geographic atrophy. However, these steps may help:

- Stop smoking: This is the most important step for lowering risk.
- Choose a healthy diet and lifestyle: Eating leafy greens, fruits, vegetables, fish and other antioxidant-rich foods may help.
- Have regular check-ups: Early detection could prevent more-serious vision conditions.
