# Neurofibroma

## Overview

A  neurofibroma is a type of peripheral nerve tumor that forms a soft bump on or under the skin. The tumor can develop within a major or minor nerve anywhere in the body.

This common type of nerve tumor tends to form centrally within the nerve. A neurofibroma forms on the protective covering of the nerve, known as the nerve sheath. Sometimes it grows on several nerve bundles. When this happens, it's called a plexiform neurofibroma.

A neurofibroma may cause mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. If the tumor presses against nerves or grows within them, it may cause pain or numbness.

A neurofibroma usually isn't cancer. Rarely, it can become cancer.

## Symptoms

A neurofibroma might cause no symptoms. If symptoms occur, they're usually mild. When a neurofibroma grows on or under the skin, symptoms may include:

- A bump on the skin. The bump may be the color of your skin or pink or tan.
- Pain.
- Bleeding.

If a neurofibroma becomes large or presses against or grows on a nerve, symptoms may include:

- Pain.
- Tingling.
- Numbness or weakness.
- Change in appearance when a large neurofibroma is on the face.

Some people with neurofibromas have a genetic condition known as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). A person with NF1 may have many neurofibromas. The number of neurofibromas increases with age.

A tumor that involves many nerves, known as a plexiform neurofibroma, can occur in a person with NF1. This type of neurofibroma can grow large and cause pain. It also can become cancerous.

## Causes

A neurofibroma can arise with no known cause, or it may appear in people with a genetic condition called neurofibromatosis type 1. Neurofibromas most often are found in people ages 20 to 30 years old.

## Risk factors

The only known risk factor for neurofibromas is having the genetic condition known as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). People with NF1 have several neurofibromas, along with other symptoms. In about half of the people with NF1, the disease was passed down from a parent. However, most people with neurofibromas don't have NF1.
