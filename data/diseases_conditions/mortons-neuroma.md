# Morton neuroma

## Overview

Morton neuroma is a damaged, enlarged nerve that causes pain on the bottom of the forefoot, usually in the area behind the third and fourth toes. The pain is usually sharp or burning. There may be pain, tingling or numbness spreading into these toes.

The exact cause of Morton neuroma is not known, but it's likely related to pressure on the nerve. High-heeled or narrow shoes may worsen the symptoms of Morton neuroma.

Many people get relief by wearing shoes with low heels and wide toe boxes and by using shoe inserts. Treatments also may include corticosteroid injections or surgery.

Morton neuroma also is called interdigital neuroma.

## Symptoms

Morton neuroma causes pain in the ball of your foot. The ball is the padded area of the bottom of the foot between the toes and arch. Usually, the pain is in the area behind and between the third and fourth toes.

The pain is often described as:

- Stabbing, shooting or burning pain in the ball of the foot.
- Feeling as if walking on a marble or stone.
- Pain that increases with activity.
- Pain, a pins and needles feeling, tingling, or numbness in the two nearby toes.
- Pain when stretching toes.
- A clicking sensation in the forefoot.

Pain is often relieved with rest or removing shoes.

### When to see a doctor

It's best not to ignore any foot pain that lasts longer than a few days. See your healthcare professional if you experience a burning pain in the ball of your foot that's not improving with a change in footwear or activities that put a strain on your feet.

## Causes

The exact cause of Morton neuroma is not known. Pressure on the affected nerve may contribute to damage and enlargement of the nerve.

The affected nerve is in a space between long bones in the forefoot called the metatarsal bones. Usually, the damaged and enlarged nerve is between the metatarsal bones that connect to the bones of the third and fourth toes. Nerves between other metatarsal bones also may be affected.

Factors that appear to worsen symptoms of Morton neuroma include:

- High-heeled or narrow shoes. High-heeled shoes or shoes with narrow toe boxes can put extra pressure on the toes and the ball of the foot.
- Activities. Walking, running or other activities that put pressure on the ball of the foot may worsen or trigger pain.

## Risk factors

Factors that appear to contribute to Morton neuroma include:

- High heels. Wearing high-heeled shoes or shoes that are tight can place extra pressure on your toes and the ball of your foot.
- Certain sports. Participating in high-impact athletic activities such as jogging or running may subject your feet to repetitive trauma. Sports that feature tight shoes, such as snow skiing or rock climbing, can put pressure on your toes.
- Foot deformities. People who have bunions, hammertoes, high arches or flatfeet are at higher risk of developing Morton neuroma.
