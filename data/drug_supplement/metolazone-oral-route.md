## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Mykrox

Zaroxolyn

## Description

Metolazone is used to treat fluid retention (edema) and swelling that is caused by congestive heart failure, kidney disease, or other medical conditions .

Metolazone is also used alone or together with other medicines to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the work load of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled .

Metolazone is a thiazide diuretic (water pill). It reduces the amount of water in the body by increasing the flow of urine, which helps to lower blood pressure .

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription .

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
