# Dapagliflozin and metformin (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Xigduo XR

## Description

Dapagliflozin and metformin combination is used together with proper diet and exercise to treat type 2 diabetes. It is also used to lower the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular (heart or blood vessel) disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors. This medicine is also used to lower the risk of cardiovascular death, hospitalization, and urgent heart failure visit in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (the heart is weak and cannot pump enough blood to the rest of the body).

Dapagliflozin and metformin combination is also used to lower the risk of worsening of kidney disease, end stage kidney disease, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with chronic kidney disease.

Dapagliflozin works in the kidneys to prevent absorption of glucose (blood sugar). This helps lower the blood sugar level. Metformin reduces the absorption of sugar from the stomach, reduces the release of stored sugar from the liver, and helps your body use sugar better. It does not help patients who have insulin-dependent or type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetic patients must use insulin injections.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet, Extended Release

It is very important to follow carefully any instructions from your doctor about:

- Other medicines—Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This especially includes nonprescription medicines such as aspirin, and medicines for appetite control, asthma, colds, cough, hay fever, or sinus problems.
- Counseling—Other family members need to learn how to prevent side effects or help with side effects if they occur. Also, patients with diabetes may need special counseling about diabetes medicine dosing changes that might occur because of lifestyle changes, such as changes in exercise and diet. Furthermore, counseling on contraception and pregnancy may be needed because of the problems that can occur in patients with diabetes during pregnancy.
- Travel—Keep a recent prescription and your medical history with you. Be prepared for an emergency as you would normally. Make allowances for changing time zones and keep your meal times as close as possible to your usual meal times.

This medicine may cause a rare but serious bacterial infection, called necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum or Fournier's gangrene, which can cause damage to the tissue under the skin in the area between and around the anus and genitals (perineum). Fournier's gangrene may lead to hospitalization, multiple surgeries, or death. Check with your doctor right away if you have fever, unusual tiredness or weakness, or pain, tenderness, redness, or swelling of the area between and around your anus and genitals.

This medicine may cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). This is more common when this medicine is taken together with other diabetes medicines (eg, insulin, glipizide, glyburide). The symptoms of low blood sugar must be treated before they cause you to pass out. People feel different symptoms with low blood sugar . It is important that you learn which symptoms you usually have so you can treat it quickly. Some symptoms of low blood sugar include: behavior changes that are similar to being drunk, blurred vision, cold sweats, confusion, cool, pale skin, difficulty with thinking, drowsiness, excessive hunger, a fast heartbeat, headaches that continue, nausea, shakiness, slurred speech, or unusual tiredness or weakness. Talk to your doctor about how to treat low blood sugar.
