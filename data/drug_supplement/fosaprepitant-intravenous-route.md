## Proper Use

A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine in a medical facility. It is given through a needle placed into one of your veins. The medicine must be given slowly, so the needle will have to remain for 30 minutes in adults, 30 minutes in children 12 to 17 years of age, and 60 minutes in children 6 months to 12 years of age.

This medicine is usually given on the first day of your chemotherapy along with other medicines (eg, dexamethasone, ondansetron) about 30 minutes before the start of treatment. Your child may receive this medicine on Days 1, 2, and 3 of chemotherapy. Your child may also receive Emend® or aprepitant capsules or oral liquid instead of Emend® or Focinvez® injection on Days 2 and 3 of chemotherapy. Fosaprepitant is not for long-term use, but you may need to use this medicine again if you have more chemotherapy in the future.

This medicine comes with a patient information insert. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have concerns.

## Precautions
