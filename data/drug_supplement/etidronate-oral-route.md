## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of etidronate in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of etidronate in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving etidronate.

### Breastfeeding

There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.

### Drug Interactions

Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.

### Other Interactions

Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.  Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur.  The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.

### Other Medical Problems

The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:

- Anemia or
- Blood clotting problems or
- Cancer or
- Dental or tooth problems or
- Dental procedures (eg, tooth extraction) or
- Infection or
- Poor oral hygiene or
- Surgery (eg, dental surgery)—May increase risk for severe jaw problems. This risk may also be increased if you use this medicine for a long time.

- Enterocolitis (severe diarrhea) or
- Hyperphosphatemia (high phosphate in the blood) or
- Stomach or bowel problems (eg, Barrett's esophagus, difficulty with swallowing, heartburn, inflammation of the esophagus, or ulcers)—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.

## Proper Use

Take this medicine only as directed . Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may increase the chance of side effects.

Make sure your doctor knows if your diet includes large amounts of calcium, such as milk or other dairy products, or if you are on any special diet, such as a low-sodium or low-sugar diet. Calcium in the diet may prevent the absorption of oral etidronate.

Take etidronate with a full glass (6 to 8 ounces) of water on an empty stomach at least 2 hours before or after food (mid-morning is best) or at bedtime. Food may decrease the amount of etidronate absorbed by your body.

Do not lie down for at least 30 minutes after taking this medicine, and do not lie down until after you have eaten some food.

In some patients, etidronate takes up to 3 months to work. If you feel that the medicine is not working, do not stop taking it on your own. Instead, check with your doctor.

It is important that you eat a well-balanced diet with an adequate amount of calcium and vitamin D (found in milk or other dairy products). Too much or too little of either may increase the chance of side effects while you are taking etidronate. Your doctor can help you choose the meal plan that is best for you. However, do not take any food, especially milk, milk formulas, or other dairy products, or antacids, mineral supplements, or other medicines that are high in calcium or iron (high amounts of these minerals may also be in some vitamin preparations), magnesium, or aluminum within 2 hours of taking etidronate. To do so may keep this medicine from working properly.

If this medicine upsets your stomach, ask your doctor if you can take two smaller doses instead of one larger dose. Do not change without talking to your doctor.

For treating Paget's disease, you may need to take this medicine for up to 6 months. Then after 90 days of not taking the medicine, your doctor may want you to start another course of treatment.

If you have Paget's disease, this medicine may work slowly, so you may not feel better until you have been using it for awhile. Do not stop taking it without talking to your doctor first. Your body may continue to respond to this medicine for several months after you stop using it.

### Dosing

The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.
