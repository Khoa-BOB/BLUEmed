## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Releuko

## Description

Filgrastim-ayow injection is used to treat neutropenia (low white blood cells) that is caused by cancer medicines. It is a synthetic (man-made) form of a substance that is naturally produced in your body called a colony stimulating factor. Filgrastim-ayow helps the bone marrow to make new white blood cells. It is also used in a procedure called leukapheresis.

Filgrastim-ayow injection is also used to treat acute radiation syndrome (radiation sickness) in patients who have been exposed to high levels (myelosuppressive doses) of radiation. Myelosuppression is a bone marrow problem that can lead to a decrease in blood cell counts.

When certain cancer medicines are used to fight cancer cells, they also affect the white blood cells that fight infections. Filgrastim-ayow is used to prevent or reduce the risk of infections while you are being treated with cancer medicines. This medicine is also used to help the bone marrow recover after a bone marrow transplantation in cancer patients.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
