## Proper Use

Vial : A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine in a medical facility. It is given through an IV that is placed in one of your veins to treat active ankylosing spondylitis, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, or psoriatic arthritis. It must be given slowly, so the IV will have to remain in place for at least 30 minutes.

Prefilled syringe or pen : You may also be taught how to give your medicine at home. It is usually given as a shot under the skin of your stomach, thigh, or upper arm to treat ankylosing spondylitis, enthesitis-related arthritis, hidradenitis suppurativa, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, plaque psoriasis, or psoriatic arthritis.

This medicine comes with a Medication Guide and patient instructions. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.

Secukinumab comes in 6 forms: a Sensoready® pen , an UnoReady® pen , a 300 mg/2 mL prefilled syringe , a 150 mg/mL prefilled syringe , a 75 mg/0.5 mL prefilled syringe for children (these 5 forms may be used at home), and vial (which is to be used only in the hospital or doctor's office). Your doctor will tell you which dosage form you should use.

You will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself or your child a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. This will help prevent skin problems from the injections. Do not inject into skin areas that are red, bruised, tender, hard, or affected by psoriasis.

Allow the medicine to warm to room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes (for Sensoready® pen, 150 mg/mL prefilled syringe, and 75 mg/0.5 mL prefilled syringe ) and 30 to 45 minutes (for UnoReady® pen and 300 mg/2 mL prefilled syringe ) before using it.

You might not use all of the medicine in each pen or prefilled syringe. Use each pen or prefilled syringe only one time. Do not save an open pen or syringe. If the medicine in the pen or syringe has changed color, or if you see particles in it, do not use it. Do not shake the medicine.

The removable cap of the Sensoready® pen or prefilled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may cause allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to latex. Tell your doctor if you have a latex allergy before you start receiving this medicine.

### Dosing

The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.

The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.

Check with your doctor right away if you have chest tightness, stomach pain, fever, itching, pain or redness of the skin, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, chills, confusion, dizziness, fast heartbeat, bone pain, diarrhea, loss of appetite, weakness, bleeding in the eye, blurred vision, trouble breathing, sneezing, or cough.

You will need to have a skin test for tuberculosis before you start using this medicine. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your home has ever had a positive reaction to a tuberculosis test or been exposed to tuberculosis.

Inflammatory bowel disease may occur while you are using this medicine. Tell your doctor right away if you have rectal bleeding, severe stomach pain, or severe diarrhea while using this medicine.
