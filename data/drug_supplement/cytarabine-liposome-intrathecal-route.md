## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Depocyt

## Description

Liposomal cytarabine belongs to the group of medicines known as antineoplastics. It is used to treat cancer of the lymph system that has spread to the brain.

Liposomal cytarabine interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal cells may also be affected by the medicine, other effects may also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Some effects may occur after treatment with liposomal cytarabine has been stopped.

Before you begin treatment with liposomal cytarabine, you and your doctor should talk about the good this medicine will do as well as the risks of using it.

Liposomal cytarabine is to be administered only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.
