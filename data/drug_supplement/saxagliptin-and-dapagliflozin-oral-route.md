## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Qtern

## Description

Saxagliptin and dapagliflozin combination is used together with proper diet and exercise to treat type 2 diabetes. Saxagliptin helps to control blood sugar levels by making the pancreas gland release more insulin. It also signals the liver to stop producing sugar when there is too much sugar in the blood. Dapagliflozin works in the kidneys to prevent absorption of glucose (blood sugar). This helps lower the blood sugar level. This medicine does not help patients who have insulin-dependent or type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetic patients must use insulin injections.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
