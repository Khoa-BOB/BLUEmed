## Proper Use

This medicine comes with patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.

To use the skin patch:

- Apply the patch right away after removing it from the protective pouch. Do not cut it into smaller pieces and do not touch the sticky surface of the patch.
- Apply the patch to a clean, dry, intact, and healthy skin area on your stomach, thigh, hip, flank (side of the body between the ribs and the pelvis), shoulder, or upper arm. Choose an area that is not very oily, has little or no hair, and is free of scars, cuts, burns, or any other skin irritation. If you need to put the patch on a hairy area, the area should be shaved at least 3 days before applying the patch. Avoid putting the patch on skin folds, under a waistband, or on areas where it could be rubbed by tight clothing.
- Press the patch firmly in place with the palm of your hand for about 30 seconds. Make sure there is good contact with your skin, especially around the edges of the patch.
- The patch should stay in place, even when you are showering, bathing, or swimming. Apply a new patch if it falls off.
- After 24 hours, remove the patch. Choose a different place on your skin to apply the new patch. Do not put a new patch in the same place for at least 14 days. Do not leave the patch on for more than 24 hours. It will not work as well after that time and it may irritate your skin.
- After removing a used patch, fold the patch in half with the sticky sides together. Place the folded, used patch in its protective pouch or in aluminum foil. Make sure to dispose of it out of the reach of children and pets. Wash the application site with soap and water to remove any drug or adhesive. You may also use baby or mineral oil to remove any excess medicine. Do not use alcohol or other solvents (eg, nail polish remover) to avoid skin irritation.
- Try to change the patch at the same time each day. If you forget to change the patch at the usual time, remove the patch you are wearing and put on a new patch. After that, apply a fresh patch at the usual time on the next day.
- Do not put cream, lotion, ointment, oil, or powder on the skin area where the patch will be placed.
- Make sure you wash your hands with soap and water before and after applying the patch.

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

This medicine may cause some people to become dizzy, drowsy, lightheaded, or faint. People using rotigotine have reported falling asleep without warning during activities of daily living, including driving, which sometimes resulted in accidents. This may happen as late as one year after taking the medicine. Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are not alert, well-coordinated, or able to think well . If these side effects are especially bothersome, check with your doctor.

This medicine may cause changes in your blood pressure or heart rate. Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur, especially when you get up from a lying or sitting position suddenly. Getting up slowly may help. If the problem continues or gets worse, check with your doctor.

This medicine may cause some people to be agitated, irritable, or display other abnormal behaviors, including confusion, delusions, feeling aggressive or hostile, or seeing, hearing, or feeling things that are not there (hallucinations). If you or your caregiver notice any of these side effects, tell your doctor right away.

Some people who have used this medicine had unusual changes in their thoughts or behavior, including an urge to gamble, spend money, binge eat, or an increased sex drive. Talk with your doctor if this is a concern for you.

This medicine may cause fluid retention (edema) in some patients. Tell your doctor right away if you have bloating or swelling of the face, arms, hands, lower legs, or feet, tingling of the hands or feet, or unusual weight gain or loss.

Check with your doctor before using this medicine with alcohol or other medicines that affect the central nervous system (CNS) . This medicine will add to the effects of alcohol and other CNS depressants (medicines that make you drowsy or less alert). Some examples of medicines that affect the CNS are antihistamines or medicine for allergies or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicines, medicine for depression, medicine for anxiety, prescription pain medicine or narcotics, medicine for attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics.

The patch contains aluminum, which can cause skin burns when used during certain procedures such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or cardioversion. To prevent skin burns, make sure the patch is removed before having these procedures.

Heat may cause too much of the rotigotine to pass through your skin. Do not expose the patch to direct sources of heat, such as heating pads, electric blankets, heat lamps, saunas, hot tubs, heated water beds, or direct sunlight. Direct sunlight may cause your skin to change color.

Tell your doctor if you develop a skin rash or irritation from the patch that lasts longer than a few days, becomes more severe, or spreads to areas outside the application site.

Do not change your dose or stop using this medicine suddenly without first asking your doctor . You will need to slowly decrease your dose before stopping it completely. Stopping this medicine suddenly may cause anxiety, confusion, depression, fever, lack of feeling or emotion, severe muscle stiffness, sweating, trouble sleeping, uncaring, or unusual tiredness or weakness.
