Twirla

## Description

Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol combination is used to prevent pregnancy in women who can get pregnant with a BMI less than 30 kilograms (kg) per square meter (m2). It works by stopping a woman's egg from fully developing each month. The egg can no longer accept a sperm and fertilization (pregnancy) is prevented.
