# Triprolidine, pseudoephedrine, and codeine (oral route)

## Description

Triprolidine, pseudoephedrine, and codeine combination is used to relieve cough, sneezing, itchy or runny nose, and nasal congestion (stuffy nose) caused by allergies or the common cold.

Triprolidine is an antihistamine that works by preventing the effects of a substance called histamine, which is produced by the body. Histamine can cause itching, sneezing, runny nose, and watery eyes. Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant, which decreases nasal congestion by narrowing the blood vessels and reducing blood flow to the nasal passage. Codeine is a narcotic antitussive (cough suppressant). It acts directly on the cough center in the brain to relieve cough.

When codeine is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, people who have continuing cough and nasal congestion should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve their cough. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your progress while you are using this medicine . This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to use it. If your symptoms do not improve or if they get worse, call your doctor.

This medicine may be habit-forming. If you feel that the medicine is not working as well, do not use more than your prescribed dose . Call your doctor for instructions.

If you think you or someone else may have taken an overdose of this medicine, get emergency help at once . Symptoms of an overdose include: extreme dizziness or weakness, trouble breathing, slow heartbeat or breathing, seizures, and cold, clammy skin.

This medicine may make you dizzy or drowsy. Do not drive or do anything else until you know how this medicine affects you .

Check with your doctor before using this medicine with alcohol or other medicines that affect the central nervous system (CNS) . The use of alcohol or other medicines that effect the CNS with triprolidine, pseudoephedrine, and codeine combination may worsen the side effects of this medicine, such as dizziness, poor concentration, drowsiness, unusual dreams, and trouble with sleeping. Some examples of medicines that affect the CNS are antihistamines or medicine for allergies or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicines, medicine for depression, medicine for anxiety, prescription pain medicine or narcotics, medicine for attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics.

Codeine is changed to morphine in the body. Some people change codeine to morphine more quickly than others. These individuals are called "ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine". Contact your doctor immediately if you experience extreme sleepiness, confusion, or shallow breathing . These symptoms may indicate that you are an "ultra-rapid metabolizer of codeine". As a result, there is too much morphine in the body and more side effects of morphine than usual. Children may be especially sensitive to this effect. Do not give this medicine to children with obstructive sleep apnea (breathing problem) who have had surgery removal of tonsils or adenoids.

If a nursing mother is an ultra-rapid metabolizer of codeine, it could lead to a morphine overdose in the nursing baby and cause very serious side effects.

For nursing mothers taking this medicine :

- Talk to your doctor if you have any questions about taking codeine or about how this medicine may effect your baby.
- Call your doctor if you become extremely tired and have difficulty caring for your baby.
- Your baby should generally nurse every 2 to 3 hours and should not sleep for more than 4 hours at a time.
- Check with your doctor, hospital emergency room, or local emergency services (eg, "call 9-1-1") right away if your baby shows signs of increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, difficulty breathing, or limpness. These may be symptoms of an overdose and need immediate medical attention.

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
