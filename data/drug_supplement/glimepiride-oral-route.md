# Glimepiride (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Amaryl

## Description

Glimepiride is used to treat high blood sugar levels caused by type 2 diabetes. It may be used alone, or in combination with insulin or another oral medicine such as metformin. In type 2 diabetes, insulin produced by the pancreas is not able to get sugar into the cells of the body where it can work properly. Using this medicine will help lower blood sugar when it is too high and help restore the way you use food to make energy. . Some people can control type 2 diabetes with diet alone or diet and exercise. Following a specially planned diet and exercising will always be important when you have diabetes, even when you are taking medicines. To work properly, the amount of glimepiride you take must be balanced against the amount and type of food you eat and the amount of exercise you do. If you change your diet, your exercise, or both, you will want to test your blood sugar to find out if it is too low. Your doctor will teach you what to do if this happens.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:
