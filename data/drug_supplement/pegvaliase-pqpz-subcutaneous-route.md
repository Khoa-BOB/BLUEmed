If you use this medicine at home, you will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. Do not inject into skin areas that are tender, red, bruised, hard, burned, inflamed, or has scars, birthmarks, rashes, moles, or tattoos.
