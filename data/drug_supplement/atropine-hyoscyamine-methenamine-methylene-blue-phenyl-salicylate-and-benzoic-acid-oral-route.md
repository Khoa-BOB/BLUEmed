Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines.

For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

Confusion or memory loss, constipation, difficult urination, excitement, agitation, drowsiness, or dryness of mouth may be more likely to occur in elderly patients, who are usually more sensitive than younger adults to the effects of atropine and hyoscyamine. Also, this combination medicine may cause eye pain in patients who have untreated glaucoma.

## Proper Use

While you are taking this combination medicine, it is important for your urine to be acidic. To do this, your doctor may recommend that you eat more protein and such foods as cranberries (especially cranberry juice with vitamin C added), plums, or prunes. You should avoid foods that make the urine more alkaline, such as most fruits (especially citrus fruits and juices), milk, and other dairy products.

Take this medicine only as directed. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may increase the chance of side effects.

Each dose should be taken with a full glass (8 ounces) of water or other liquid (except citrus juices and milk). Drink plenty of water or other liquids every day, unless otherwise directed by your doctor. Drinking enough liquids will help your kidneys work better and lessen your discomfort.

To help clear up your infection completely, keep taking this medicine for the full time of treatment even if you begin to feel better after a few days. Do not miss any doses.

In order for this medicine to work well, your urine must be acid (pH 5.5 or below). To make sure that your urine is acid:

- Before you start taking this medicine, check your urine with phenaphthazine paper or another test to see if it is acid. If you have any questions about this, check with your health care professional.
- You may need to change your diet; however, check with your doctor first if you are on a special diet (for example, for diabetes). To help make your urine more acid you should avoid most fruits (especially citrus fruits and juices), milk and other dairy products, and other foods which make the urine more alkaline. Eating more protein and foods such as cranberries (especially cranberry juice with vitamin C added), plums, or prunes may also help. If your urine is still not acid enough, check with your doctor.

## Precautions

If your symptoms do not improve within a few days or if they become worse, check with your doctor.

These medicines may make you sweat less, causing your body temperature to increase.
