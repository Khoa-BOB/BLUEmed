## Description

Deferasirox is used to remove excess iron from the body in patients who have had too many blood transfusions and in patients with non-transfusion dependent thalassemia syndromes.

Deferasirox is an iron chelator (binder). It combines with iron in the blood. The combination of iron and deferasirox is then removed from the body by the kidneys. If you have too much iron in the body, it can damage various organs and tissues.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet for Suspension
- Granule

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of deferasirox in children. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children with transfusional iron overload who are younger than 2 years of age , or in children with chronic iron overload and non-transfusional-dependent thalassemia who are younger than 10 years of age .

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of deferasirox in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have unwanted effects and age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving deferasirox.
