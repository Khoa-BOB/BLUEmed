## Description

Fluticasone belongs to the family of medicines known as corticosteroids (cortisone-like medicines). It is used to help prevent the symptoms of asthma. When used regularly (every day), inhaled fluticasone decreases the number and severity of asthma attacks. However, it will not relieve an asthma attack that has already started.

This medicine must be used with a short-acting medicine (eg, albuterol) for an asthma attack or asthma symptoms that need attention right away.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Powder
- Aerosol Powder

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Corticosteroids taken by mouth or injection have been shown to slow or stop growth in children and cause reduced adrenal gland function. If enough fluticasone is absorbed following inhalation, it is possible it also could cause these effects. Your doctor will want you to use the lowest possible dose of fluticasone that controls asthma. This will lessen the chance of an effect on growth or adrenal gland function. It is also important that children taking fluticasone visit their doctors regularly so that their growth rates may be monitored. Children who are taking this medicine may be more susceptible to infections, such as chickenpox or measles. Care should be taken to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles. If the child is exposed or the disease develops, the doctor should be contacted and his or her directions should be followed carefully. Before this medicine is given to a child, you and your child's doctor should talk about the good this medicine will do as well as the risks of using it.

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of ArmonAir® Digihaler™ and Flovent® HFA in children 4 years of age and older as maintenance treatment for asthma. However, safety and efficacy have not been established for ArmonAir® Digihaler™ and Flovent® HFA in children younger than 4 years of age.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of fluticasone in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of Arnuity® Ellipta® , Flovent® Diskus® , or Flovent® HFA than younger adults. Elderly patients are also more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving Armonair® or Arnuity® Ellipta® . .

## Precautions

If you will be using this medicine for a long time, it is very important that your doctor check your or you child's progress at regular visits . This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to check for any unwanted effects.

Although this medicine decreases the number of asthma episodes, it may increase the chance of a severe asthma attack when they do occur. Be sure to read about these risks in the patient information leaflet and talk to your doctor or pharmacist about any questions or concerns that you have.

You should not use this medicine if your asthma attack has already started. Your doctor will prescribe another medicine (eg, a short-acting inhaler) for you to use in case of an acute asthma attack. Make sure you understand how to use the short-acting inhaler. Talk to your doctor if you need instructions.

Talk with your doctor or get medical care right away if:

- Your or your child's symptoms do not improve after using this medicine for 2 weeks or if they become worse.
- Your short-acting inhaler does not seem to work as well as it used to and you or your child need it more often than normal (eg, you use 1 whole canister of the short-acting inhaler in 8 weeks time, or you need to use 4 or more inhalations of the short-acting inhaler for 2 or more days in a row).
- You or your child have a big decrease in your peak flow when measured as directed by your doctor.

This medicine may cause a fungus infection of the mouth or throat (thrush). Tell your doctor right away if you have white patches in the mouth or throat, or pain when eating or swallowing.
