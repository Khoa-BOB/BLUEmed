## Brand Name

Revlimid

## Description

Lenalidomide is used to treat anemia (low red blood cells) in patients with a certain type of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Patients with MDS may have very low red blood cell counts and require blood transfusions.

Lenalidomide is also used in combination with dexamethasone to treat multiple myeloma (plasma cell cancer). It is also used as maintenance treatment in patients with multiple myeloma after an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (stem cell transplant that uses your own stem cells).

Lenalidomide is also used to treat mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in patients who have been treated previously with bortezomib and one additional medicine that did not work well.

Lenalidomide is also used together with rituximab to treat previously treated follicular lymphoma (FL) and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL).

This medicine is available only under a restricted distribution program called the Lenalidomide REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Capsule
