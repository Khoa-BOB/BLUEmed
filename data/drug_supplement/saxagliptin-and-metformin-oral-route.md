# Saxagliptin and metformin (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Kombiglyze XR

## Description

Saxagliptin and metformin combination is used together with proper diet and exercise to treat high blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. Saxagliptin helps to control blood sugar levels by increasing substances in the body that make the pancreas release more insulin. It also signals the liver to stop producing sugar (glucose) when there is too much sugar in the blood. Metformin reduces the absorption of sugar from the stomach, reduces the release of stored sugar from the liver, and helps your body use sugar better.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet, Extended Release
