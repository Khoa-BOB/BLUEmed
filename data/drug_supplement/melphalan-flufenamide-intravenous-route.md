Melphalan flufenamide injection is used in combination with dexamethasone to treat multiple myeloma (bone marrow cancer) in patients whose cancer has come back and who have received at least 4 previous treatments (eg, a CD38-directed monoclonal antibody, a proteasome inhibitor, and an immunomodulatory agent) that did not work well.

This medicine can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:

- If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.
- Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.
- Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.
- Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.
- Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.
- Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.

This medicine may cause serious infections (eg, respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, sepsis). Check with your doctor right away if you have chest pain, chills, confusion, cough, dizziness or lightheadedness, fainting, fast heartbeat, fever, sneezing, sore throat, tightness in the chest, or trouble breathing.

Using this medicine may increase your risk of getting other types of cancer (eg, myelodysplastic syndromes, acute leukemia). Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about this risk.
