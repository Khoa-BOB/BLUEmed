## Proper Use

A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine. It is given as a shot under your skin, usually in the stomach or thigh.

This medicine comes with patient instructions. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.

Elamipretide may sometimes be given at home to patients who do not need to be in a hospital or clinic. If you are using this medicine at home, your doctor or nurse will teach you how to prepare and inject the medicine. Be sure that you understand how to use the medicine.

If you use this medicine at home, you will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. This will help prevent skin problems. Do not inject into skin areas that are tender, red, bruised, hard, or have scars or stretch marks.

Allow the medicine to warm to room temperature for 10 minutes before using it.

Check the liquid in the vial. It should be clear, colorless to yellow. Do not use if it is discolored, cloudy, or has lumps, flakes, or particles in it. Do not use the vial if it has cracks or if the plastic cap is broken or missing.

To use the injection:

- Remove the plastic cap on the vial if you are using a new one. Clean the top of the vial stopper with an alcohol wipe before each injection. Do not mix this medicine with other medicines in the same syringe.
- Hold the syringe by the barrel with the needle cap pointing straight up and carefully pull the cap straight off. Fill the syringe with air by pulling back on the plunger to the prescribed dose.
- With the vial on a flat surface and in upright position, insert the needle straight down into the center of the vial rubber stopper. Slowly inject all the air from the syringe into the vial. Keep the needle inside the vial.
- Turn the vial and syringe upside down with one hand. Slowly pull back on the plunger to withdraw the prescribed dose. Keep the needle inside the vial. Check for air bubbles. If you see large air bubbles, gently tap the side of the syringe.
- Slowly push the plunger up to push the large air bubbles back into the vial. Pull back on the plunger again more slowly to fill the syringe to your prescribed dose.
- Return the vial into upright position and place it on a flat surface. While holding the vial with one hand and the barrel of the syringe between fingertips of your other hand, pull the needle straight out of the vial. Keep the syringe in your hand. Do not set it down.
