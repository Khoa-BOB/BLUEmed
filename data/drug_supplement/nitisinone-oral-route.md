To use the Nityr® tablet :

- If you are unable to swallow the tablet whole, you can mix the tablet with water in an oral syringe or crush the tablet and mix with applesauce. Do not mix it with any other food or liquid. To prepare for an applesauce mixture: Wash your hands well before preparing the medicine. Measure about 1 teaspoon of applesauce and put it into a clean container (eg, glass or bowl). Place the tablet onto a spoon. Crush one tablet at a time between 2 spoons until the tablet is crushed to a fine powder. Carefully place the powder into the clean container of applesauce. Make sure that no tablet powder remains on the teaspoon. If more than 1 tablet is needed, repeat the previous steps. Stir the mixture well. Swallow all of the mixture right away or within 2 hours of mixing. Repeat this step until no mixture is left in the container. Measure another 1 teaspoon of applesauce and place it in the container. Stir the fresh applesauce with any remaining tablet powder until mixed well. Swallow this mixture right away. This will make sure any remaining medicine in the container is administered. To prepare for an oral syringe: Wash your hands well before preparing the medicine. Use only 1 or 2 tablets in an oral syringe at a time. For 1 tablet: place the tablet in the oral syringe. Add 2.6 milliliters (mL) of room temperature water and pull the plunger back to the 3 mL mark. For 2 tablets: place the 2 tablets in the oral syringe. Add 5 mL of room temperature water. Replace the cap on the syringe and let it sit for at least 15 minutes for 2 milligrams (mg) tablets and at least 60 minutes for 5 mg or 10 mg tablets. Turn the syringe up and down for at least 30 seconds. Check the mixture in the syringe. The tablet should have broken down into small pieces and are evenly spread in the water (suspension). Do not take the suspension if there are any large pieces of tablet in it or if there are any tablet pieces that are not evenly spread through the water. If the tablet is not fully dissolved, let it sit for another 10 minutes. Then, turn the syringe up and down for at least 30 seconds. Place the tip of the syringe in the mouth. If you are giving it to a child, place the tip of the syringe along the inner cheek of the child's mouth. Slowly push the plunger down until a small amount of air is left in the syringe, between the plunger and the tip. Do not press the plunger all the way down to the end of the syringe. Draw up an additional 2 mL of water into the syringe. Replace the cap on the syringe. Shake well to spread the remaining tablet pieces evenly through the water. If particles are still present, repeat this step one more time.

Check with your doctor right away if blurred vision, difficulty seeing at night, sensitivity of the eyes to sunlight, or any other changes in vision occur during or after treatment. Your doctor may want your eyes be checked by an ophthalmologist (eye doctor).

Nitisinone can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:

- If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.
- Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.
- Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.
- Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.
- Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.
- Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.

The oral suspension contains glycerol and may cause diarrhea, an upset stomach, or headaches. Let your doctor know if you have these symptoms.
