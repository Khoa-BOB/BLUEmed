# Alosetron (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Lotronex

## Description

Alosetron is used to treat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in women who have diarrhea as their main symptom. This medicine is only used in severe cases of IBS that have not responded to other therapy. IBS is also known as irritable colon or spastic colon. IBS may be caused by a chemical called serotonin, which causes your intestinal system to be overactive. Alosetron works by blocking the action of serotonin on the intestine. This reduces the cramping abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, urgency (sudden need for a bowel movement), and diarrhea caused by IBS. Alosetron does not cure IBS and may not help every person who takes it.

Alosetron is available through a restricted marketing program. Only doctors enrolled in the prescribing program can write a prescription for alosetron.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
