## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Savaysa

## Description

Edoxaban is used to prevent stroke and blood clots in patients with a certain heart rhythm problem (eg, nonvalvular atrial fibrillation).

Edoxaban is also used to treat deep venous thrombosis, a condition in which harmful blood clots form in the blood vessels of the legs. These blood clots can travel to the lungs and can become lodged in the blood vessels of the lungs, causing a condition called pulmonary embolism. This medicine is used in patients who have been treated with an injectable blood thinner for 5 to 10 days.

Edoxaban is a factor Xa inhibitor, an anticoagulant. It works by decreasing the clotting ability of the blood and helps prevent harmful clots from forming in the blood vessels.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
