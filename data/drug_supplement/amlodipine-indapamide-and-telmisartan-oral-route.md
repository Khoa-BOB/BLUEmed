# Amlodipine, indapamide, and telmisartan (oral route)

## Description

Telmisartan, amlodipine, and indapamide combination is used alone or together with other medicines to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure may reduce the risk of strokes and heart attack.

Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker (CCB). It affects the movement of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. As a result, amlodipine relaxes the blood vessels and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart while reducing its workload.

Indapamide is a thiazide-like diuretic (water pill). It reduces the amount of water in the body by increasing the flow of urine, which helps lower the blood pressure.

Telmisartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). It works by blocking a substance in the body that causes the blood vessels to tighten. As a result, olmesartan relaxes blood vessels. This lowers the blood pressure and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
