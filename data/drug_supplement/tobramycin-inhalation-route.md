Tobi® is used together with a DeVilbiss® Pulmo-Aide® compressor, while Bethkis® is used together with a PARI Vios air compressor. An air compressor is used with a nebulizer to turn the medicine into a fine spray. You will breathe the spray in through your mouth and into your lungs.
- Use the mouthpiece of the nebulizer to breathe in Bethkis®.
- You will need to use the nebulizer for about 10 to 15 minutes, or until the medicine in the nebulizer cup is gone. You may hear a sputtering sound when the cup is empty.
- Clean all the parts of the nebulizer after each use.
- You may want to rinse your mouth or suck on hard candy if the Tobi® inhalation solution leaves a bad taste in your mouth.

- This medicine is especially formulated to be used with the Podhaler™ device.
- Store the capsules in the blister pack until you are ready to use them.
- Always use a new Podhaler™ device every 7 days.
- To inhale this medicine, breathe out fully, trying to get as much air out of the lungs as possible. Put the mouthpiece in your mouth with the device upright.
- Breathe in slowly and deeply.
- Hold your breath for about 5 seconds, then breathe out slowly.
- Check if the capsule is empty after inhaling. If some powder remains in the capsule, repeat inhalation until the capsule is empty.
