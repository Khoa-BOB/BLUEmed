# Fosinopril (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Monopril

## Description

Fosinopril is used alone or together with other medicines to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the work load of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled .

Fosinopril works by blocking an enzyme in the body that is necessary to produce a substance that causes blood vessels to tighten. As a result, the blood vessels relax. This lowers blood pressure and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart .

In addition, fosinopril is used to treat congestive heart failure or may be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor .

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription .

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
