# Cabotegravir (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Vocabria

## Description

Cabotegravir is used together with rilpivirine for short-term treatment of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This medicine is usually given to patients to replace their current anti-HIV medicines when their healthcare provider determines that they meet certain requirements. It is used to assess how well you tolerate cabotegravir before receiving cabotegravir/rilpivirine combination injection (Cabenuva) or in patients who will miss a planned injection of Cabenuva.

Cabotegravir is also used for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of HIV-1 infection. Your doctor may do tests to make sure you are negative from HIV-1 infection before taking this medicine for HIV-1 PrEP. This medicine is used to assess how well you tolerate cabotegravir before receiving cabotegravir injection (Apretude) or in patients who will miss a planned injection of Apretude.

Cabotegravir will not cure or prevent HIV infection or AIDS. It helps keep HIV from reproducing and appears to slow down the destruction of the immune system. This may help delay problems that are usually related to AIDS or HIV disease from occurring. This medicine will not keep you from spreading HIV to other people. People who receive this medicine may continue to have other problems usually related to AIDS or HIV disease.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
