# Basiliximab (intravenous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Simulect

## Description

Basiliximab belongs to a group of medicines known as immunosuppressive agents. It is used to lower the body's natural immunity in patients who receive kidney transplants.

When a patient receives a kidney transplant, the body's white blood cells will try to get rid of (reject) the transplanted kidney. Basiliximab works by preventing the white blood cells from getting rid of the transplanted kidney. The effect of basiliximab on the white blood cells may also reduce the body's ability to fight infections.

Basiliximab is to be administered only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Powder for Solution

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Studies on the use of basiliximab in children have not been completed. Preliminary information on the use of basiliximab in children suggests children have the same side effects from receiving basiliximab as those experienced by adult patients, and basiliximab works as well to prevent rejection of the transplanted kidney in children as it does in adult patients.

### Geriatric

Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way as they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing use of basiliximab in the elderly with use in other age groups.

There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.
