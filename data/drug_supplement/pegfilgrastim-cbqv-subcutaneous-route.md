## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress at regular visits to make sure this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

Check with your doctor right away at the first sign of an infection, including fever, chills, cough, sore throat, or unusual tiredness or weakness.

Check with your doctor right away if you or your child are having pain in the upper left part of your stomach or at the tip of the left shoulder. This could be a symptom of a serious side effect with the spleen.

Check with your doctor right away if you or your child develop a fever, chest pain or tightness, or trouble breathing. These could be symptoms of a serious lung condition called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you or your child has a rash, itching skin, dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting, swelling of the face, tongue, or throat, trouble breathing, or chest pain after you receive the medicine.

This medicine may cause kidney problems. Call your doctor right away if you or your child has swelling in your face or ankles, blood in the urine, or decrease in how much or how often you urinate.

If you are receiving this medicine via the On-body Injector (OBI) for Udenyca® :

- Tell your doctor if you have an allergy to acrylic adhesives.
- Keep the injector at least 4 inches away from electrical equipment, including cell or cordless phones, microwaves, and other appliances.
- Do not use bathtubs, hot tubs, whirlpools, or saunas while you are wearing the injector. Do not expose the injector to sunlight. Call your doctor if the injector comes off before or during a dose.
- Keep the injector dry at least 3 hours before the dose is scheduled to start. This will help you notice any leaks. Call your doctor if the bandage becomes wet or the medicine is dripping.
- The injector is programmed to deliver your dose about 27 hours after it is placed on your skin. It will take about 5 minutes for the dose to be given. Avoid driving, operating heavy machinery, or traveling during hours 26 to 29 after the injector is placed on your skin. This includes the 5-minute dose delivery period. You must have a caregiver nearby for your first dose.
- You should avoid airport X-ray scans and request a manual pat down instead.
- Do not sleep on, or apply pressure to, the OBI for Udenyca®. Doing so may prevent the OBI from working properly.
- You should avoid getting body lotions, creams, oils, or cleaning agents near the OBI for Udenyca® as these products may loosen the adhesive that holds the OBI onto your body.

This medicine may cause a condition called capillary leak syndrome. It can cause fluid to leak from the blood vessels into your body's tissues. Call your doctor right away if you or your child have swelling or puffiness and are urinating less often, trouble breathing, feeling of fullness, dizziness, or feeling faint.

This medicine lowers the number of some types of blood cells in your body. Because of this, you may bleed more easily. Wash your hands often. Stay away from rough sports or other situations where you could be bruised, cut, or injured. Brush and floss your teeth gently. Be careful when using sharp objects, including razors and fingernail clippers. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child has black or tarry stools, bleeding gums, blood in the urine or stools, pinpoint red spots on the skin, or unusual bleeding or bruising after receiving this medicine.

This medicine may cause aortitis (inflammation of the aorta, the largest artery in the body). Check with your doctor right away if you have fever, stomach pain, unusual tiredness or weakness, or back pain.

This medicine may cause blood or bone marrow problems (eg, myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia) in patients with breast or lung cancer. Check with your doctor right away if you have chest pain, chills, cough or hoarseness, fever, lower back or side pain, painful or difficult urination, sores, ulcers, or white spots on the lips or in the mouth, swollen glands, unusual bleeding or bruising, or unusual tiredness or weakness.
