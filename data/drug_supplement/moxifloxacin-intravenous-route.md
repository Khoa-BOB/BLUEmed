Serious side effects can occur during treatment with this medicine. Sometimes serious side effects can occur without warning. However, possible warning signs include: black, tarry stools, blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, bloody or cloudy urine, chills, decreased urination, diarrhea, fever, joint or muscle pain, red skin lesions, often with a purple center, sores, ulcers, or white spots in the mouth or on the lips, severe stomach pain, skin rash, swelling of the face, fingers, feet, or lower legs, unusual bleeding or bruising, unusual weight gain, or yellow skin or eyes.

Moxifloxacin may cause diarrhea, and in some cases it can be severe. It may occur 2 months or more after you stop using this medicine.
