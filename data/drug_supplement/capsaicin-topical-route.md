## Description

Capsaicin is used to help relieve a certain type of pain known as neuralgia (shooting or burning pain in the nerves). Capsaicin is also used to help relieve minor pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis or muscle sprains and strains. Qutenza® patch is also used to treat nerve pain caused by diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the feet. It will not cure any of these conditions.

Neuralgia is a pain that comes from the nerves near the surface of your skin. This pain may occur after an infection with herpes zoster (shingles or postherpetic neuralgia). Capsaicin will help relieve the pain of postherpetic neuralgia, but it will not cure the condition.

Qutenza® is to be given only by your doctor. Zostrix® is available both over-the-counter (OTC) and with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Cream
- Lotion
- Patch, Extended Release
- Solution

## Precautions

If you use the Qutenza® patch:

- Your blood pressure will be measured while the patch is on your skin and after it has been removed. If you notice any change to your recommended blood pressure at home, call your doctor right away. If you have questions about this, talk to your doctor.
- You may have some skin redness, burning, or a stinging sensation at the application site. Heat, humidity, bathing in warm water, or sweating may increase the burning sensation. If this irritation is severe or does not go away, call your doctor.
- Your skin may be more sensitive to heat and sunlight. Use a sunscreen when you are outdoors. Avoid sunlamps and tanning beds.

If you use the cream, gel, lotion, or ointment:

- You may have some skin redness, burning, or a stinging sensation at the application site. Although this usually disappears after the first several days, it may last 2 to 4 weeks. Heat, humidity, bathing in warm water, or sweating may increase the burning sensation. If this irritation is severe or does not go away, call your doctor.
- The burning sensation will not improve or go away if you reduce the number of doses you use each day. Using fewer doses may also reduce the amount of pain relief you get.
