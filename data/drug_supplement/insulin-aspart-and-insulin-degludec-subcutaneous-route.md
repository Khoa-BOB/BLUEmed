# Insulin aspart and insulin degludec (subcutaneous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Ryzodeg 70/30

## Description

Insulin aspart is a fast-acting type of insulin. Insulin degludec is a long-acting type of insulin that works slowly, over about 24 hours. Insulin is one of many hormones that help the body turn the food we eat into energy. This is done by using the glucose (sugar) in the blood as quick energy. Also, insulin helps us store energy that we can use later. When you have diabetes mellitus, your body cannot make enough insulin or does not use insulin properly. This causes you to have too much sugar in your blood. Like other types of insulin, insulin aspart and insulin degludec combination is used to keep your blood sugar level close to normal.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

## Before Using

### Pediatric

Always double-check both the concentration (strength) of your insulin and your dose. Concentration and dose are not the same. The dose is how many units of insulin you will use. The concentration tells how many units of insulin are in each milliliter (mL), such as 100 units/mL (U-100), but this does not mean you will use 100 units at a time.

It is best to use a different place on the body for each injection (eg, under the skin of your abdomen or stomach, thigh, or upper arm). Do not use the same exact spot for each injection . If you have questions about this, contact a member of your health care team.

The insulin solution should look clear and colorless. Do not use it if it is cloudy or thickened. Do not mix this medicine with any other insulin or with water.
