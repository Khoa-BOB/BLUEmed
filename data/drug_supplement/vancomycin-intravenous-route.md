## Description

Vancomycin injection is used to treat infections in many different parts of the body (eg, bone infections, infective endocarditis, lower respiratory tract infections, septicemia, skin and skin structure infections). It is also used in patients with heart valve disease (eg, rheumatic fever) or prosthetic (artificial) heart valves who are allergic to penicillin. Under certain circumstances, vancomycin is also given with other medicines to prevent endocarditis (inflammation of the lining of the heart) in patients who are having dental work done or surgery on the upper respiratory tract (eg, nose or throat).

Vancomycin is used to treat infections caused by bacteria. It works by killing bacteria or preventing their growth. Vancomycin will not work for colds, flu, or other virus infections.

Vancomycin injection is also used to treat serious infections for which other medicines may not work. However, this medicine may cause some serious side effects, including damage to your hearing and kidneys. These side effects may be more likely to occur in elderly patients. You and your doctor should talk about the benefits this medicine will do as well as the risks associated with receiving it.
