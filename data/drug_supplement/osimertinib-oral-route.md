## Description

Osimertinib is used to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients who have certain types of abnormal epidermal growth factor (EGFR) genes. This medicine is used to prevent NSCLC from coming back in patients whose tumor has been removed by surgery. It is also used to treat locally advanced (cancer that has spread to nearby tissues), unresectable (cannot be removed by surgery) stage III NSCLC that has responded with other cancer medicines (eg, platinum-based chemotherapy) and radiation treatment. This medicine is also used as a first-line treatment of metastatic (cancer that has spread to other parts of the body) NSCLC. It is also used in combination with other cancer medicines (eg, pemetrexed, platinum-based chemotherapy) as a first-line treatment of metastatic or locally advanced NSCLC. This medicine is also used to treat metastatic NSCLC in patients who have already received EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment, which did not work. Your doctor will perform a test to check for the EGFR gene before you use this medicine.

Osimertinib belongs to the group of medicines called antineoplastics (cancer medicines). It works by interfering with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
