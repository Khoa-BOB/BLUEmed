- This medicine is available in 2 different strengths and patch sizes. Make sure you have the right strength patch that has been prescribed for you.
- When handling the skin patch, be careful not to touch the adhesive (sticky) surface with your hand. The adhesive part of the system contains some donepezil, which can be absorbed into your body too fast through the skin of your hand.

Avoid putting the patch over skin folds, across the spine, or on areas where it could be rubbed by tight clothing or undergarments.

Slowly peel the blue tinted liner while applying gentle pressure with fingers of your other hand to smooth the patch firmly in place, press the patch firmly with the palm of your hands for 30 seconds to make sure there is good contact with your skin, especially around the edges of the patch.
- If the patch falls off after applying it, throw it away and apply a new patch in a different area.
- Do not touch your eyes after applying the patch. Rinse it off right away with water if it does get in your eyes or if your eyes becomes red after touching the patch.
