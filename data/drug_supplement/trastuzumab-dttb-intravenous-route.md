## Description

Trastuzumab-dttb injection is used to treat HER2-overexpressing node positive or node negative (ER/PR negative or with one high risk feature) breast cancer. It can be used alone after a previous treatment with an anthracycline medicine or with other cancer medicines (eg, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, docetaxel, doxorubicin, paclitaxel).

Trastuzumab-dttb injection is also used alone to treat HER2-overexpressing metastatic (cancer that has spread) breast cancer in patients who have previously received one or more cancer treatments. It is also used together with paclitaxel for the first-line treatment of HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer.

Trastuzumab-dttb injection is also used in combination with cisplatin and capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil to treat HER2-overexpressing metastatic (cancer that has spread to other parts of the body) stomach cancer called gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma in patients who have not previously received treatment.

Trastuzumab-dttb prevents the growth of some tumors that produce extra amounts of a certain substance known as the HER2 protein. It should only be used in patients whose tumors have been shown to produce extra amounts of this protein (HER2 overexpression) . Your doctor will test for the presence of this protein.

Trastuzumab-dttb is a monoclonal antibody. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by trastuzumab-dttb, other effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Powder for Solution

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

Use an effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant during treatment and for 7 months after the last dose. If you think you have become pregnant while receiving the medicine, tell your doctor right away.

Your doctor may test your heart before you start receiving trastuzumab-dttb injection and while you are getting treatments with this medicine. This medicine may cause heart problems (eg, heart failure, heart rhythm problems, heart muscle problems, and high blood pressure). Check with your doctor right away if you have blurred vision, chest pain or tightness, decreased urine output, dilated neck veins, dizziness, extreme fatigue, fainting, fast or slow heartbeat, headache, irregular breathing, irregular heartbeat, nervousness, pounding in the ears, swelling of the face, fingers, feet, or lower legs, trouble breathing, or weight gain.

If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:

- If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.
- Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.
- Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.
- Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.
- Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects, such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.
