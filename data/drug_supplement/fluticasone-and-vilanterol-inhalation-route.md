## Description

Fluticasone and vilanterol combination is used to help control the symptoms of asthma and improve lung function. It is used when a patient's asthma has not been controlled sufficiently on other asthma medicines, or when a patient's condition is so severe that more than one medicine is needed every day. This medicine will not relieve an asthma attack that has already started.

Fluticasone and vilanterol combination used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It is used long term to improve breathing problems and to reduce the number of COPD flare-ups (worsening of your COPD symptoms for several days). This medicine will not relieve a COPD attack that has already started.

Inhaled fluticasone belongs to the family of medicines known as corticosteroids or steroids (cortisone-like medicines). It works by preventing certain cells in the lungs and breathing passages from releasing substances that cause COPD and asthma symptoms.

Inhaled vilanterol is a long-acting bronchodilator. Bronchodilators are medicines that are breathed in through the mouth to open up the bronchial tubes (air passages) in the lungs.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

## Proper Use

Inhaled fluticasone and vilanterol combination is used to prevent asthma attacks and treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is not used to relieve an asthma attack that has already started. For relief of an asthma attack that has already started, you should use another medicine. If you do not have another medicine to use for an attack or if you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.

Use this medicine only as directed by your doctor . Do not use more of it and do not use it more often than your doctor ordered. Also, do not stop using this medicine without telling your doctor. To do so may increase the chance of side effects.

Inhaled fluticasone and vilanterol combination comes with a patient information leaflet and patient instructions. Read the directions carefully before using this medicine. If you do not understand the directions or you are not sure how to use the inhaler, ask your doctor to show you what to do. Also, ask your doctor to check regularly how you use the inhaler to make sure you are using it properly.

Use this medicine at the same time each day.

Do not stop using this medicine or other breathing medicines that your doctor has prescribed for you unless you have discussed this with your doctor.

To use the inhaler:

- This medicine comes in a foil tray. Peel back the lid to open the tray.
- Slide the inhaler cover down until you hear a clicking sound. The inhaler is now ready to use. Do not open the cover of the inhaler until you are ready to use it. If you open and close the inhaler without inhaling the dose, you will lose the medicine.
- Turn your head away from the inhaler and breathe out fully. Do not breathe into the inhaler.
- Put the mouthpiece between your lips and close your lips around the mouthpiece. Do not block the air vent with your fingers.
- Breathe in through your mouth as deeply as you can until you have taken a full deep breath. Do not breathe through your nose.
- Hold your breath and remove the mouthpiece from your mouth. Continue holding your breath as long as you can up to 3 or 4 seconds before breathing out slowly. This gives the medicine time to settle in your airways and lungs.
- When you are finished, you may clean the mouthpiece with a dry tissue, if needed, before closing the inhaler cover.
- The inhaler has a window that shows the number of doses that are left. This tells you when you are getting low on medicine. When the inhaler has less than 10 doses left, the left half of the counter will show up in red to remind you to refill your prescription.
