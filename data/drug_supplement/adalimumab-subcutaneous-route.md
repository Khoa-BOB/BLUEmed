## Description

Adalimumab injection is used to treat the symptoms and prevent the progression of active rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. It is used in children 2 years of age and older for juvenile idiopathic arthritis. This medicine is also used to treat psoriatic arthritis, which is a type of arthritis that causes pain and swelling in the joints along with patches of scaly skin on some areas of the body. Psoriatic arthritis usually occurs with a skin condition called psoriasis. Adalimumab may be used alone or in combination with medicines (eg, methotrexate or DMARDs).

Adalimumab injection is also used to treat the symptoms of active Crohn's disease in adults and children 6 years of age and older who have not been helped by other medicines, including infliximab. It is also used to treat moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in adults and children 5 years of age and older who have been treated with other medicines (eg, azathioprine, corticosteroids, or 6-mercaptopurine) that did not work well.

Adalimumab injection may also be used to treat chronic plaque psoriasis, which is a skin disease with red patches and white scales that do not go away. It is also used to treat moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa, a chronic skin disease that has small, painful lumps under the skin in adults and children 12 years of age and older. This medicine is also used to treat non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in adults and children 2 years of age and older.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of adalimumab injection for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis and non-infectious uveitis in children 2 years of age and older , for the treatment of Crohn's disease in children 6 years of age and older , for the treatment of ulcerative colitis in children 5 years of age and older , or for the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa in children 12 years of age and older . However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 2 years of age for juvenile idiopathic arthritis and non-infectious uveitis, in children younger than 5 years of age for ulcerative colitis, in children younger than 6 years of age for Crohn's disease, in children younger than 12 years of age for hidradenitis suppurativa, and in children for other conditions.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of adalimumab injection in the elderly. However, this medicine may cause serious infections and cancer more often in the elderly, which may require caution in patients receiving adalimumab injection.

Do not inject into skin areas that are red, bruised, tender, or hard. If you have psoriasis, do not inject into a raised, thick, red, or scaly skin patch or into skin lesions.

## Precautions

If you will be using this medicine for a long time, it is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress at regular visits . This will allow your doctor to see if this medicine is working properly and to decide whether you should continue to use it. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

You or your child will need to have a skin test for tuberculosis before using this medicine. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your home has ever had a positive reaction to a tuberculosis skin test.

Adalimumab can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, which may increase the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:

- If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.
- Check with your doctor right away if you or your child notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.
- Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.
- Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.
- Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.
- Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. Using abatacept (Orencia®) or anakinra (Kineret®) together with this medicine may increase your risk of having serious side effects .

This medicine may cause other unwanted effects that may not occur until months or years after this medicine is used. A small number of people (including children and teenagers) who have used this type of medicine have developed certain types of cancer (eg, leukemia). Some patients also developed a rare type of cancer called lymphoma. Talk with your doctor if you or your child have unusual bleeding, bruising, or weakness, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, underarms, or groin, or unexplained weight loss. Also, check with your doctor right away if your or your child's skin has red, scaly patches, or raised bumps that are filled with pus.

Adalimumab may cause serious allergic reactions (eg, anaphylaxis and angioneurotic edema), which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have a cough, difficulty swallowing, dizziness, fast heartbeat, large, hive-like swelling on the face, eyelids, lips, tongue, throat, hands, legs, feet, sex organs, rash, itching, trouble breathing, or unusual tiredness or weakness after you receive the medicine.

This medicine may cause nervous system problems. Check with your doctor right away if you have dizziness, vision problems, or numbness, tingling, or weakness in your arms or legs.

Check with your doctor right away if you or your child has swelling of the face, fingers, feet, or lower legs, or sudden weight gain. These may be signs of a heart condition called congestive heart failure (CHF).

Some people who have used this medicine developed lupus-like syndrome or autoimmune hepatitis during treatment. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child start having chest pain, joint pain, a rash on the cheeks or arms that is sensitive to the sun, dark urine or pale stools, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, stomach pain, or yellow skin or eyes.

Do not have any live vaccines (immunizations) while you or your child are being treated with adalimumab. Your child's vaccines need to be current before using adalimumab. Be sure to ask your child's doctor if you have any questions about this.

Serious skin reactions can occur during treatment with this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child has blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, red skin lesions, severe acne or skin rash, sores or ulcers on the skin, or fever or chills while using this medicine.

The needle cover of the prefilled syringe or pen contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may cause allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to latex. Tell your doctor if you have a latex allergy before you start receiving this medicine.

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
