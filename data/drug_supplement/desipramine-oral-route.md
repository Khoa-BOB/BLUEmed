Some people may have trouble sleeping, get upset easily, have a big increase in energy, or start to act reckless.

If you take them together or do not wait 2 weeks, you may develop confusion, agitation, restlessness, stomach or intestinal symptoms, a sudden high body temperature, an extremely high blood pressure, or seizures.
