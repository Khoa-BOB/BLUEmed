If your or your child's symptoms do not improve within a few days or if they become worse, check with your doctor.

This medicine may increase your risk of having some unwanted effects in the nose. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have bloody mucus, sores inside the nose, unexplained nosebleeds, or a whistling sound when you breathe while you are using this medicine.

You may get infections more easily while you are using this medicine. Avoid being around people who are sick or have infections such as chickenpox or measles or if you have never had these infections. This is especially important for children. Tell your doctor right away if you think you have been exposed to chickenpox or measles.

This medicine may cause thrush (a type of fungus infection) in the nose or throat. Tell your doctor right away if you or your child have white patches in the throat, or pain when you eat or swallow.
