## Description

Influenza virus vaccine is used to prevent infection by the influenza viruses. The vaccine works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease. It is also known as a “flu shot”.

There are many kinds of influenza viruses, but not all will cause problems in any given year. Therefore, before the influenza vaccine is produced each year, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. and Canadian Public Health Services decide which viruses will most likely cause influenza infections for that year. The antigens, which are substances that cause protective antibodies to be formed, for these viruses are included in the influenza vaccine. Usually, the U.S. and Canada use the same influenza vaccine, however, they are not required to do so.

It is necessary to receive an influenza vaccine injection each year, since influenza infections are usually caused by different kinds of viruses and the protection gained by the vaccine lasts for less than a year.

Influenza is a virus infection of the throat, bronchial tubes, and lungs. It causes fever, chills, cough, headache, muscle aches, and pains in your back, arms, and legs. In addition, adults and children weakened by other diseases or medical conditions, and persons 50 years of age and older, even if they are healthy, may get a much more serious illness that may have to be treated in a hospital. Each year, thousands of people die as a result of an influenza infection.

The best way to help prevent influenza infections is to get an influenza vaccination each year, usually in early November. Immunization (getting a vaccine) against influenza is approved for infants 6 months of age and older, all children, and all adults (including 65 years of age and older).

This vaccine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor or other health care professional.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Suspension

When you are receiving this vaccine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.

## Proper Use

A nurse or other trained health professional will give you or your child this vaccine. It is given as a shot into one of your muscles or into your skin, usually in the upper arm.

Sometimes there is not enough flu vaccine for everyone. If this happens and you are a healthy adult, you might need to wait until later in the flu season before getting your vaccination.

You need to get the flu vaccine every year to protect you from the flu.

Some children may need a second dose of the vaccine. If your child needs a second dose of the vaccine, it is very important for your child to receive the second dose on schedule. If you must cancel the appointment, make another appointment as soon as possible.

Fluzone® Intradermal Quadrivalent and Fluzone® Quadrivalent come with a patient information leaflet. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.

## Precautions

It is very important that your child return to your doctor’s office at the right time if your child needs a second dose of the vaccine . Be sure to notify your doctor of any side effects that occur after you or your child receive this vaccine.

This vaccine may cause a serious allergic reaction called anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you or your child have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after receiving the injection.

Children who have received a certain brand of the influenza vaccine (Afluria®, Afluria® Quadrivalent) have developed a fever and in some cases a fever with seizures. Talk with your doctor if you have concerns about this.

If you are very sick and have a high fever, you will probably need to wait until you are well before you receive this vaccine.

This vaccine may not protect everyone who receives it. It will not also treat flu symptoms if you already have the virus.

The tip cap of the prefilled syringe for certain brands of the injection ( Agriflu®, Fluvirin® ) contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may cause allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to latex. Tell your doctor if you or your child have a latex allergy before you receive this vaccine.

Fainting may occur after you receive this vaccine. Your doctor may want you to be observed after you get the injection to prevent and manage fainting.

Tell your doctor if you or your child are using a medicine or treatment that weakens your immune system, including steroid, radiation, or cancer treatment. This vaccine may not work as well if you are also using these treatments. Your doctor may still want you to get the vaccine because it can give you some protection.
