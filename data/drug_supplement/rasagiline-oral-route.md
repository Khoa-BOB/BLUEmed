If you experience signs and symptoms of high blood pressure, you should seek immediate medical attention . Signs and symptoms include severe headache, blurred vision or visual disturbances, difficulty thinking, stupor or coma, seizures, chest pain, unexplained nausea or vomiting.

Make sure your doctor knows about all the other medicines you are using. Rasagiline may cause a serious condition called serotonin syndrome when used with some medicines. This especially includes medicines used to treat depression, such as citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, olanzapine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, Celexa®, Cymbalta®, Effexor®, Lexapro®, Luvox®, Paxil®, Prozac®, Sarafem®, Symbyax®, or Zoloft®.

These could be symptoms of serotonin syndrome.

This medicine may make you dizzy or drowsy. It may even cause you to fall asleep without warning while you drive, talk, or eat. Do not drive or do anything that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you .

This medicine will add to the effects of alcohol and other CNS depressants (medicines that make you drowsy or less alert). Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for hay fever, other allergies, or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine, prescription pain medicine or narcotics, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics. Check with your medical doctor or dentist before taking any of the above while you are taking this medicine .

If you are taking this medicine with levodopa, you may experience increased dyskinesia (eg, twitching, twisting, uncontrolled repetitive movements of tongue, lips, face, arms, or legs). Check with your doctor if you have any of these symptoms.

Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur, especially when you get up from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help. If you should have this problem, check with your doctor.

These could be symptoms of a serious condition called neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).

Do not stop taking rasagiline without first checking with your doctor . Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are taking before stopping completely.

It is important that your doctor check your skin regularly for signs of a skin cancer called melanoma. If you notice any unusual red, brown, or black spots on your skin, talk to your doctor right away.
