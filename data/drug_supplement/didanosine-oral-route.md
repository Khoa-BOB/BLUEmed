# Didanosine (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Videx

Videx EC

Videx Pediatric

## Description

Didanosine is used in combination with other medicines for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).

Didanosine will not cure or prevent HIV infection or AIDS. It helps keep HIV from reproducing and appears to slow down the destruction of the immune system. This may help delay the development of problems usually related to AIDS or HIV disease. Didanosine will not keep you from spreading HIV to other people. People who receive this medicine may continue to have the problems usually related to AIDS or HIV disease.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

The buffered tablets that are to be chewed, crushed or mixed with water are no longer available in the United States. This product was voluntarily discontinued, and it was not due to safety concerns. Didanosine delayed-release capsules (Videx® EC) and pediatric powder for oral solution are still available.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Capsule, Delayed Release

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

Do not use didanosine if you or your child are also using allopurinol (Zyloprim®), ribavirin (Copegus®, Rebetol®), or stavudine (Zerit®). Using these medicines together may cause serious side effects .

This medicine may cause a life-threatening condition called pancreatitis. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have more than one of these symptoms: bloating, chills, constipation, darkened urine, a fast heartbeat, fever, indigestion, loss of appetite, nausea, pains in the stomach, side, or abdomen, possibly radiating to the back, vomiting, or yellow eyes or skin.

Two rare but serious reactions to this medicine are lactic acidosis (too much acid in the blood) and liver toxicity, which includes an enlarged liver. These are more common if you are female, very overweight (obese), or have been taking anti-HIV medicines for a long time. Call your doctor right away if you or your child have more than one of these symptoms: abdominal or stomach discomfort or cramping, dark urine, decreased appetite, diarrhea, a general feeling of discomfort, light-colored stools, muscle cramping or pain, nausea, unusual tiredness or weakness, trouble breathing, vomiting, or yellow eyes or skin.

Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have abdominal or stomach pain, black, tarry stools, bleeding gums, blood in the urine or stools, pinpoint red spots on the skin, or unusual bleeding or bruising. These may be symptoms of a condition called non-cirrhotic portal hypertension.

Tell your doctor right away if you or your child start having numbness, tingling, or burning pain in your hands, arms, legs, or feet. These may be symptoms of a condition called peripheral neuropathy.

Your immune system may get stronger when you start taking HIV medicines. Sometimes the immune system will start to fight infections that were hidden in your body, such as pneumonia or tuberculosis, or may result in a flare-up of a hidden autoimmune disorder such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, or Guillain-Barré syndrome. Tell your doctor right away if you notice any changes in your health.
