# Aldesleukin (intravenous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Proleukin

## Description

Aldesleukin injection is used to treat renal cell carcinoma (a type of kidney cancer) and melanoma (a type of skin cancer) that have spread throughout the body (metastatic).

Aldesleukin is a man-made version of a substance called interleukin-2. Interleukins are produced naturally by cells in the body to help white blood cells work.

If severe side effects occur, which is common, treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU) may be necessary. Other effects may not be serious but may cause concern. Before you begin treatment with aldesleukin, you and your doctor should talk about the benefits this medicine will do as well as the risks of using it.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
