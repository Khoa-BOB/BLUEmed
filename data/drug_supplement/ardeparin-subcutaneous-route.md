# Ardeparin (subcutaneous route)

## Description

Ardeparin is used to prevent deep venous thrombosis, a condition in which harmful blood clots form in the blood vessels of the legs. These blood clots can travel to the lungs and can become lodged in the blood vessels of the lungs, causing a condition called pulmonary embolism. Ardeparin is used for several days after knee replacement surgery, while you are unable to walk. It is during this time that blood clots are most likely to form. Ardeparin also may be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.

Ardeparin is available only with your doctor's prescription.
