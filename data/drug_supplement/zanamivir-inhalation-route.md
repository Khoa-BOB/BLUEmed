## Description

Zanamivir belongs to the family of medicines called antivirals, which are used to treat infections caused by viruses. Zanamivir is used in the treatment of the infection caused by the flu virus (influenza A and influenza B). This medicine may also be used to prevent and treat swine influenza A.

Zanamivir may reduce flu symptoms (weakness, headache, fever, cough, runny or stuffy nose, and sore throat) by 1 to 1.5 days. Zanamivir may also be used to prevent influenza infection if you have come into close contact with someone who has the flu.

This medicine must be started within 2 days of having flu symptoms. Zanamivir will not keep you from spreading the flu virus to other people. It may not work for everybody. Zanamivir may not be for you if you are severely sick or have a breathing problem (e.g., asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). If you receive the flu vaccine every year, continue to do so. Zanamivir is not a substitute for your yearly flu shot.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

## Proper Use

Talk to your doctor about the possibility of getting a flu shot if you have not had one yet . This medicine works best if used as soon as possible after exposure to people who have the flu. If you already have the flu, continue using this medicine for the full time of treatment even if you begin to feel better after a few days . This will help to clear up your infection completely.

Inhaled zanamivir is to be used only with a special inhaler (Diskhaler®). Do not mix this medicine with other solutions. Do not use this medicine in any nebulizer or mechanical ventilator .

This medicine usually comes with patient instructions. Read them carefully before using the medicine. If you do not understand the directions or you are not sure how to use the inhaler, ask your doctor to show you how to use it.

To load the inhaler :

- Pull off the blue cover. Make sure the mouthpiece is clean and free of foreign objects.
- Pull the white mouthpiece until the tray is extended.
- Hold the corners of the white tray and pull out gently until you can see all the raised ridges on the sides of the tray.
- Put your finger and thumb on the ridges, squeeze inward, and gently pull the tray out of the body of the inhaler.
- Place a disk on the wheel and then slide the tray back into the inhaler.
- To replace the empty disk with a full disk, follow the same steps you used to load the inhaler.

To use the inhaler :

- Hold the inhaler flat in your hand.
- A plastic needle will break the blister containing one inhalation of medicine. When the flap is raised as far as it will go, the blister will be pierced. Do not lift the flap if the cartridge is not in the inhaler. Doing this will break the needle and you will need a new inhaler.
- After the blister is broken open, close the lid. Keeping the inhaler flat and well away from your mouth, breathe out to the end of a normal breath.
- Raise the inhaler to your mouth, and place the mouthpiece in your mouth.
- Close your lips around the mouthpiece and tilt your head slightly back. Do not bite down on the mouthpiece. Do not block the mouthpiece with your teeth or tongue. Do not cover the air holes on the side of the mouthpiece.
- Breathe in through your mouth as steadily and as deeply as you can until you have taken a full deep breath.
- Hold your breath and remove the mouthpiece from your mouth. Continue holding your breath as long as you can up to 10 seconds before breathing out. This gives the medicine time to settle in your airways and lungs.
- Hold the inhaler well away from your mouth and breathe out to the end of a normal breath.
- Prepare the cartridge for your next inhalation. Pull the mouthpiece to extend the tray then push it in until it clicks. The disk will turn to the next dose. Do not pierce the blister until just before the inhalation.
- Take the second puff following exactly the same steps you used for the first puff.
- When you are finished, wipe off the mouthpiece and replace the cover to keep the mouthpiece clean and free of foreign objects.

If you are also using another inhaled bronchodilator (e.g., albuterol, Atrovent®, Combivent®, or Serevent®), use it before you use zanamivir.
