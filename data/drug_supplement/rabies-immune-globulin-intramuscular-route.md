## Description

Rabies immune globulin is used together with rabies vaccine to prevent infection caused by the rabies virus. It works by giving your body the antibodies it needs to protect it against the rabies virus. This is called passive protection. This passive protection lasts long enough to protect your body until it can produce its own antibodies against the rabies virus.

Rabies immune globulin is given to persons who have been exposed (eg, by a bite, scratch, or lick) to an animal that is known or thought to have rabies. This is called post-exposure prophylaxis. Rabies immune globulin is used only in persons who have never before received the rabies vaccine.

Rabies infection is serious and often fatal. In the U.S., rabies in wild animals, especially raccoons, skunks, and bats, accounts for the most cases of rabies passed on to humans, pets, and other domestic animals. In Canada, the animals most often infected with rabies are foxes, skunks, bats, dogs, and cats. Horses, swine, and cattle have also been known to become infected with rabies. In much of the rest of the world, including Latin America, Africa, and Asia, dogs account for the most cases of rabies passed on to humans.

If you are being (or will be) treated for a possible rabies infection while traveling outside of the U.S. or Canada, contact your doctor as soon as you return to the U.S. or Canada, since it may be necessary for you to have additional treatment.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the supervision of your doctor or other health care professional.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
