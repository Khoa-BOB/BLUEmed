# Rivastigmine (transdermal route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Exelon

## Description

Rivastigmine transdermal patch is used to treat mild, moderate, and severe dementia (memory loss and mental changes) associated with Alzheimer's disease or mild to moderate dementia associated with Parkinson's disease. Rivastigmine will not cure these diseases and it will not stop these diseases from getting worse. However, rivastigmine can improve thinking ability in some patients with these diseases.

In Alzheimer's disease, many chemical changes take place in the brain. One of the earliest and biggest changes is that there is a decrease in a chemical called acetylcholine (ACh). ACh helps the brain to work properly. Rivastigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. It slows the breakdown of ACh, so it can build up and have a greater effect. However, as Alzheimer's disease gets worse, there will be less and less ACh, so rivastigmine may not work as well.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Patch, Extended Release
