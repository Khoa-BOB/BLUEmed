## Description

Note: Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant should not use this medicine or handle the crushed or open capsules . Finasteride can cause birth defects in male babies.

Finasteride and tadalafil combination is used to treat men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). BPH is caused by an enlarged prostate. Men with BPH usually have difficulty urinating, a decreased flow of urination, hesitation at the beginning of urination, and a need to get up at night to urinate. This medicine will make these symptoms less severe and reduce the chance that prostate surgery will be needed.

Finasteride blocks the action of an enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase. This enzyme changes testosterone to another hormone that causes the prostate to grow. It will increase testosterone levels in the body, which decreases prostate size. The effect of finasteride will only last as long as the medicine is taken.

Tadalafil belongs to a group of medicines called phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors. These medicines prevent an enzyme called phosphodiesterase type-5 from working too quickly. The prostate is one of the areas where this enzyme works.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Capsule
