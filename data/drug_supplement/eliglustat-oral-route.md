# Eliglustat (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Cerdelga

## Description

Eliglustat is used for the long-term treatment of type 1 Gaucher disease. However, it is only used in certain people with type 1 Gaucher disease. Your doctor will perform a test to make sure that this medicine is right for you.

Type 1 Gaucher disease is a disease you get from both your parents. People with type 1 Gaucher disease lack an enzyme (naturally occurring substance in your body) that breaks down a chemical in your body called glucosylceramide. Too much glucosylceramide causes liver and spleen enlargement, changes in the blood, and bone disease. Eliglustat works by stopping the body from making glucosylceramide.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Capsule
