# Aprocitentan (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Tryvio

## Description

Aprocitentan is used together with other medicines to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) in patients whose blood pressure is not well controlled. High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled.

This medicine is available only under a restricted distribution program called the Tryvio™ REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
