# Aliskiren, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Amturnide

## Description

Aliskiren, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide is a combination of medicines that may be used alone or with other medicines to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure will reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks.

Aliskiren is a renin inhibitor. It works by blocking an enzyme in the body that is necessary to produce a substance that causes blood vessels to tighten. As a result, the blood vessels relax and this decreases the blood pressure. When the blood pressure is lowered, the amount of blood and oxygen that go to the heart is increased.

Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker. It affects the movement of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. As a result, amlodipine relaxes the blood vessels and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart while reducing its workload.

Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic (water pill). It reduces the amount of water in the body by increasing the flow of urine, which helps lower blood pressure.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
