## Description

Note: Women of childbearing potential should not use or handle this medicine . Dutasteride can cause birth defects in male fetuses.

Dutasteride and tamsulosin combination is used to treat men who have symptoms of an enlarged prostate gland, which is also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Benign enlargement of the prostate is a problem that can occur in men as they get older. The prostate gland is located below the bladder. When the prostate gland gets larger, certain muscles in the gland get in the way of the tube that drains urine from the bladder. This can cause problems with urinating, such as a need to urinate often, a weak stream when urinating, or a feeling of not being able to empty the bladder completely.

Dutasteride blocks the action of an enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase. This enzyme changes testosterone to another hormone that causes the prostate gland to grow. Dutasteride will cause the size of the prostate to decrease, but the effect lasts only as long as the medicine is taken. If it is stopped, the prostate begins to grow again.

Tamsulosin helps relax the muscles in the prostate gland and the opening of the bladder. This may help increase the flow of urine or decrease symptoms.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Capsule

If a pregnant woman does come in contact with this medicine, the affected area should be washed right away with soap and water, especially if the capsule is broken.

Because this medicine may cause some people to become dizzy or feel faint, make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy or are not alert .

Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur after you take this medicine, especially when you get up suddenly from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help with this problem. If you feel dizzy, lie down so you do not faint . Then sit for a few moments before standing to prevent the dizziness from returning.
