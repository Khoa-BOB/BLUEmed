# Saquinavir (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Invirase

## Description

Saquinavir is used together with ritonavir (Norvir®) and other antiviral medicines for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).

Saquinavir will not cure or prevent HIV infection or AIDS. It helps keep HIV from reproducing and slows the destruction of the immune system. This may help delay problems related to AIDS or HIV disease from occurring. Saquinavir will not keep you from spreading HIV to other people.

This medicine (tablet) is available only with your doctor's prescription. The capsules are not currently being marketed .

## Before Using
