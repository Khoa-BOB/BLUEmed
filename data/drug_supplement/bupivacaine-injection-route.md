## Proper Use

A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine in a hospital. Marcaine™ is sometimes given through a catheter placed into your lower back for an epidural or a spinal block. Posimir® is usually given in the shoulder area.

Posimir® should not be used to ease labor pains during childbirth.

This medicine should cause numbness only to the area where it is injected. You may experience temporary loss of sensation or movement in the injected area. This type of numbing procedure is called local anesthesia. It is not meant to cause you to fall asleep or become unconscious.

You may experience temporary loss of sensation and movement, usually in the lower half of your body, if you receive this medicine into your lower back (epidural). It may be easier to hurt yourself while your treated body area is still numb. Be careful to avoid injury until you have regained all the feeling and are no longer numb.

To avoid injury after dental work, do not chew solid foods until normal feeling has returned to the area. Do not test the feeling in your mouth by biting or poking the treated area (up to 7 hours).

If you are receiving this medicine as an epidural to ease labor pains , it may take longer than normal for you to push your baby out. It is also possible that the baby may have unwanted effects after birth (including sleepiness, slow responses). Talk to your doctor if you have questions about how this medicine might affect your baby.

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress closely while receiving this medicine to see if it is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for any unwanted effects.

This medicine may cause a rare, but serious blood problem called methemoglobinemia. The risk may be increased in children younger than 6 months of age, elderly patients, or patients with certain inborn defects. It is more likely to occur in patients receiving too much of the medicine, but can also occur with small amounts. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child has the following symptoms after receiving this medicine: pale, gray, or blue-colored skin, lips, or nails, confusion, headache, lightheadedness, fast heartbeat, or unusual tiredness or weakness.

This medicine may cause a bone or joint problem called chondrolysis. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have bone or joint pain or stiffness or an inability to move.

This medicine may cause low blood pressure (hypotension). This is more likely in patients with blood vessel problems, including high blood pressure (hypertension) or a decrease in blood volume. Check with your doctor right away if you have confusion, dizziness, faintness, or lightheadedness when getting up suddenly from a lying or sitting position, sweating, or unusual tiredness or weakness.

Bupivacaine injection may also cause a dangerous increase in body temperature (hyperthermia). Check with your doctor if you or your child have fast shallow breathing, a fast, weak heartbeat, headache, muscle cramps, pale, clammy skin, or an extremely high fever or body temperature.

This medicine may make you dizzy or drowsy. Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you.

Check with your doctor before receiving this medicine with other medicines that affect the central nervous system (CNS). The use of other medicines that affect the CNS with bupivacaine injection may worsen the side effects of this medicine, such as dizziness, poor concentration, drowsiness, unusual dreams, and trouble with sleeping. Some examples of medicines that affect the CNS are antihistamines or medicine for allergies or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicines, medicine for depression, medicine for anxiety, prescription pain medicine or narcotics, medicine for attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, or muscle relaxants.

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
