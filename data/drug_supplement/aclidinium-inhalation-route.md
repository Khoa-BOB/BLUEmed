# Aclidinium (inhalation route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Tudorza Pressair

## Description

Aclidinium is used as maintenance treatment in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a lung disease that also includes chronic bronchitis (swelling of the tubes leading to the lungs) or emphysema (damage to the air sacs in the lungs). This medicine will not relieve a COPD attack that has already started.

Aclidinium belongs to the family of medicines known as bronchodilators. These are medicines that are breathed in through the mouth to help open up the bronchial tubes (air passages) in the lungs. They relieve cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, and troubled breathing by increasing the flow of air through the bronchial tubes.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Aerosol Powder

## Proper Use

Inhaled aclidinium is used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is not used to relieve a COPD attack that has already started. For relief of an COPD attack that has already started, you should use another medicine. If you do not have another medicine to use for an attack or if you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.

This medicine is used with a special inhaler that comes with a patient information leaflet and patient instructions. Read the directions carefully before using the medicine. If you do not understand the directions or you are not sure how to use the inhaler, ask your doctor to show you what to do. Also, ask your doctor to check regularly how you use the inhaler to make sure you are using it properly.

Use this medicine at the same time each day.

Do not stop using this medicine or other breathing medicines that your doctor has prescribed for you unless you have discussed this with your doctor.

To use the inhaler:

- This medicine comes in a sealed pouch. Do not open the pouch until you are ready to use it. Do not press the green button until you are ready to take a dose.
- Remove the cap by squeezing and pulling it off the mouthpiece. Check the mouthpiece to make sure it is clear.
- Hold the inhaler with the mouthpiece facing you and the green button is on top. Press the green button all the way down and release it. Do not tilt the inhaler.
- Check the control window to make sure your dose is ready for inhalation. Look if the colored control window changed from red to green. If it is still red, repeat the steps to prepare your dose.
- To inhale this medicine, breathe out fully and try to get as much air out of your lungs as possible. Put your lips tightly around the mouthpiece and breathe in quickly and deeply until you hear a "click" sound. Keep breathing in, even after you hear the "click" sound to be sure you get the full dose.
