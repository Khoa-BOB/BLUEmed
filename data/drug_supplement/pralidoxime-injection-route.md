# Pralidoxime (injection route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Protopam Chloride

## Description

Pralidoxime injection is used together with another medicine called atropine to treat poisoning caused by organic phosphorus pesticides (e.g., diazinon, malathion, mevinphos, parathion, and sarin) and by organophosphate chemicals (“nerve gases”) used in chemical warfare.

Pralidoxime injection is also used to treat overdose of medicines (e.g., ambenonium, neostigmine, pyridostigmine), that are used to treat myasthenia gravis. Poisoning with these chemicals or medicines causes your muscles, including the muscles that help you breathe, to become weak. Pralidoxime is used to help you get back strength in your muscles.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor or trained military personnel.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Powder for Solution

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of pralidoxime injection in children.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of pralidoxime injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving pralidoxime injection.

### Breastfeeding

There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.

### Drug Interactions

Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.

### Other Interactions

Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.  Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur.  Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.

### Other Medical Problems

The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:

- Kidney disease—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.

- Myasthenia gravis (severe muscle weakness)—Use with caution. May make this condition worse.

## Proper Use

A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine in a hospital or clinic. You may also be taught how to give your medicine at home. This medicine is preferably given through a needle placed in one of your veins. It may also be given as a shot under your skin or into a muscle.

This medicine is available in two forms: a vial and an autoinjector.

For patients using the pralidoxime autoinjector (automatic injection device):

- You will be trained to use the pralidoxime autoinjector by a medic or other trained military personnel. You will also be told the conditions under which it should be used.
- The autoinjector also comes with patient directions. Read them carefully before you actually need to use this medicine. Then, when an emergency arises, you will know how to inject the pralidoxime.
- It is important that you do not remove the safety cap on the autoinjector until you are ready to use it. This prevents spillage of the medicine from the device during storage and handling.
- To use the pralidoxime autoinjector: Remove the gray safety cap. Place the black tip of the device on the thigh, with the injector pointed straight at the thigh. Press hard into the thigh until the autoinjector functions. Hold in place for several seconds. Remove the autoinjector and dispose of it as directed. Massage the injected area for 10 seconds.
