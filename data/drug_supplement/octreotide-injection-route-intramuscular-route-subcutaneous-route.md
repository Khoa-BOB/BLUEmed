# Octreotide (injection route, intramuscular route, subcutaneous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Bynfezia Pen

SandoSTATIN

SandoSTATIN LAR Depot

## Description

Octreotide injection is used to treat severe diarrhea and other symptoms that occur with certain intestinal tumors (eg, vasoactive intestinal peptide tumors or VIPomas) or metastatic carcinoid tumors (tumors that has already spread in the body). It does not cure the tumor but it helps the patient feel more comfortable.

Octreotide injection is also used to treat a condition called acromegaly, which is caused by too much growth hormone in the body. Too much growth hormone produced in adults causes the hands, feet, and parts of the face to become large, thick, and bulky. Other problems, such as arthritis, can also develop. Octreotide works by reducing the amount of growth hormone that is produced by the body.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Solution
- Powder for Suspension

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of the short-acting form of octreotide injection or the long-acting form of octreotide injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been demonstrated.

### Geriatric

Although appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of octreotide injection have not been performed in the geriatric population, geriatric-specific problems are not expected to limit the usefulness of octreotide injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving octreotide injection.
