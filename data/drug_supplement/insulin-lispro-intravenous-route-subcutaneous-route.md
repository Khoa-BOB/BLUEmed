## Description

Insulin lispro is a fast-acting type of insulin. Insulin is one of many hormones that helps the body turn the food we eat into energy. This is done by using the glucose (sugar) in the blood as quick energy. Also, insulin helps us store energy that we can use for later. When you have diabetes mellitus, your body cannot make enough or does not use insulin properly. So, you must take additional insulin to regulate your blood sugar and keep your body healthy. This is very important as too much sugar in your blood can be harmful to your health.

Insulin lispro starts to work faster than some other types of insulin, and its effects do not last as long. It should act more like the insulin your body would normally produce. Because the effects of insulin lispro are short-acting, your doctor may also prescribe a longer-acting insulin for you to use.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Solution

## Proper Use

A nurse or other trained health professional may give you this medicine. You may also be taught how to give your medicine at home. This medicine is given as a shot under your skin or into a vein.

Always double-check both the concentration (strength) of your insulin and your dose. Concentration and dose are not the same. The dose is how many units of insulin you will use. The concentration tells how many units of insulin are in each milliliter (mL), such as 100 units/mL (U-100), but this does not mean you will use 100 units at a time.

Each package of insulin lispro contains a patient information leaflet and patient instructions. Read this leaflet carefully and make sure you understand:

- How to prepare the medicine.
- How to inject the medicine.
- How to use a disposable insulin delivery device.
- How to use an external insulin pump.
- How and when to change the infusion set, cartridge adapter, and insulin in the external insulin pump reservoir.
- How and when to change the insulin lispro 3 mL cartridge.
- How to dispose of syringes, needles, and injection devices.

It is best to use a different place on the body for each injection (eg, under the skin of your stomach, thigh, buttocks, or upper arm). Do not use the exact same spot for each injection . If you have questions about this, contact a member of your health care team.

Do not inject into skin areas that are tender, bruised, scaly, hard, damaged, thick, or has pits, lumps, or scars.

When used as a mealtime insulin, it should be taken within 15 minutes before a meal or immediately after a meal.

The insulin solution should look clear and colorless. Do not use insulin lispro if it is cloudy or thickened, discolored, or if there are particles in it. Do not mix this medicine with any other insulin. If you are told to mix lispro with a longer-acting insulin, draw up insulin lispro into the syringe first, then the longer-acting insulin. Inject it right away.

When used in an insulin pump : Carefully read and follow the external insulin pump instructions. This insulin should not be mixed with any other insulin or diluted when used in an insulin pump. The insulin lispro in the pump should be changed at least every 7 days and the infusion set and insertion site changed at least every 3 days. If you do not understand how you are to use the insulin pump or have concerns, contact your doctor or pharmacist.

Use a new needle for the Admelog® SoloStar® pen or prefilled pens each time you give yourself an injection. Always remove and throw the needle after each injection. Store the pen without a needle attached. Do not use the pen if it is broken or damaged.

Follow carefully the special meal plan your doctor gave you . This is the most important part of controlling your condition, and is necessary if the medicine is to work properly. Also, exercise regularly and test for sugar in your blood or urine as directed.

Do not change the brand, type, or dose of your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. When you receive a new supply of insulin, check the label to be sure if it is the correct type of insulin.

Do not transfer Humalog® U-200 from the prefilled pen to a syringe for use.

- Counseling—Other family members need to learn how to prevent side effects or help with side effects if they occur. Also, patients with diabetes may need special counseling about diabetes medicine dosing changes that might occur because of lifestyle changes, such as changes in exercise and diet. Furthermore, counseling on contraception and pregnancy may be needed because of the problems that can occur in patients with diabetes during pregnancy.
- Travel—Keep a recent prescription and your medical history with you. Be prepared for an emergency as you would normally. Make allowances for changing time zones and keep your meal times as close as possible to your usual meal times.

In case of emergency: There may be a time when you need emergency help for a problem caused by your diabetes. You need to be prepared for these emergencies. It is a good idea to:

- Wear a medical identification (ID) bracelet or neck chain at all times. Also, carry an ID card in your wallet or purse that says that you have diabetes and a list of all of your medicines.
- Keep an extra supply of insulin lispro and syringes with needles or injection devices on hand in case high blood sugar occurs.
- Keep some kind of quick-acting sugar handy to treat low blood sugar.
- Have a glucagon kit and a syringe and needle available in case severe low blood sugar occurs. Check and replace any expired kits regularly.

This medicine may cause a serious allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, swelling of the face, tongue, and throat, trouble breathing, or chest pain after you receive this medicine.

You may have some skin redness, rash, itching, or swelling at the injection site. If this irritation is severe or does not go away, call your doctor. Do not inject insulin lispro into a skin area that is red, swollen, or itchy.

Using this medicine together with other diabetes medicine (eg, pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, Actos®, Actoplus Met®, Avandia®) may cause serious heart problems or edema (fluid retention). Check with your doctor immediately if you are rapidly gaining weight, chest pain or discomfort, extreme tiredness or weakness, trouble breathing, uneven heartbeat, or excessive swelling of the hands, wrist, ankles, or feet.

Too much insulin lispro can cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Low blood sugar can also occur if you use insulin lispro with another antidiabetic medicine, changes in insulin regimen (eg, insulin strength, type of insulin, injection site), delay or miss a meal or snack, exercise more than usual, drink alcohol, or cannot eat because of nausea or vomiting or have diarrhea. Low blood sugar must be treated before it causes you to pass out (unconsciousness). People feel different symptoms of low blood sugar . It is important that you learn which symptoms you usually have so that you can treat it quickly. Talk to your doctor about the best way to treat low blood sugar.

Symptoms of low blood sugar include anxiety, behavior change similar to being drunk, blurred vision, cold sweats, confusion, depression, difficulty in thinking, dizziness or lightheadedness, drowsiness, excessive hunger, fast heartbeat, headache, irritability or abnormal behavior, nervousness, nightmares, restless sleep, shakiness, slurred speech, and tingling in the hands, feet, lips, or tongue.

If symptoms of low blood sugar occur, eat glucose tablets or gel, corn syrup, honey, or sugar cubes, or drink fruit juice, non-diet soft drink, or sugar dissolved in water to relieve the symptoms. Also, check your blood for low blood sugar. Go to a doctor or a hospital right away if the symptoms do not improve. Someone should call for emergency help immediately if severe symptoms, such as convulsions (seizures) or unconsciousness occur. Have a glucagon kit available, along with a syringe and needle, and know how to use it. Members of your household should also know how to use it.

Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) may occur if you do not take enough or skip a dose of your antidiabetic medicine or insulin, changes in insulin regimen, you overeat or do not follow your meal plan, have a fever or infection, or do not exercise as much as usual. High blood sugar can be very serious and must be treated right away. It is important that you learn which symptoms you have in order to treat it quickly. Talk to your doctor about the best way to treat high blood sugar.

Symptoms of high blood sugar include blurred vision, drowsiness, dry mouth, flushed, dry skin, fruit-like breath odor, increased urination, ketones in the urine, loss of appetite, stomachache, nausea or vomiting, tiredness, trouble breathing (rapid and deep), unconsciousness, and unusual thirst. If these symptoms occur, check your blood sugar level and then call your doctor for instructions.
