# Tucatinib (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Tukysa

## Description

Tucatinib is used in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine to treat metastatic HER2-postive breast cancer (cancer that has already spread including the brain) or whose cancer cannot be removed by surgery in patients who have received one or more anti-HER2 breast cancer treatments.

Tucatinib is also used in combination with trastuzumab to treat RAS wild-type HER2 positive colorectal cancer (cancer of the colon or rectum) that has spread throughout the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery (advanced). Your doctor will use a special test to look for these mutations. It is given in patients who have received other cancer treatments (eg, fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan) that did not work well.

Tucatinib belongs to the group of medicines, called antineoplastics. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal cells may also be affected by the medicine, other unwanted effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet

## Before Using

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of tucatinib in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

### Geriatric
