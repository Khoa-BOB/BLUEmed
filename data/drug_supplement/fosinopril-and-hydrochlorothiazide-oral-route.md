# Fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide (oral route)

## Description

Fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide combination is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled.

Fosinopril works by blocking an enzyme in the body that is necessary to produce a substance that causes blood vessels to tighten. As a result, the blood vessels relax. Hydrochlorothiazide works by helping to reduce the amount of salt and water in the body by acting on the kidneys to increase the flow of urine. Both of these medicines lower blood pressure and increase the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
