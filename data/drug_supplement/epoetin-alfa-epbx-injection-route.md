## Description

Epoetin alfa-epbx injection is used to treat anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who may or may not be on dialysis. This medicine may also be used to prevent or treat anemia that is caused by surgery or medicines (eg, zidovudine) that are used for other conditions, such as HIV or cancer.

Epoetin alfa-epbx injection is a man-made version of human erythropoietin (EPO). EPO is produced naturally in the body, mostly by the kidneys. It causes the bone marrow to produce red blood cells. If the body does not produce enough red blood cells, severe anemia can occur. This often occurs in people with chronic kidney failure whose kidneys are not working properly.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's blood on a regular basis while you are using this medicine . Blood tests are needed to check for unwanted effects. You may also need to monitor your blood pressure at home. If you notice any changes to your recommended blood pressure, call your doctor right away.

This medicine may increase your risk of having a heart attack, stroke, congestive heart failure, and blood clotting problems. Check with your doctor right away if you start having dizziness, fainting spells, severe tiredness, chest pain, trouble breathing, sudden or severe headache, or problems with vision, speech, or walking.

People with severe anemia usually feel very tired and sick. When epoetin begins to work, usually in about 6 weeks, most people start to feel better. Some people are able to be more active. However, epoetin only corrects anemia. It has no effect on kidney disease, cancer, or any other medical problem that needs regular medical attention. Even if you or your child are feeling much better, it is very important that you do not miss any appointments with your doctor or any dialysis treatments .

Using epoetin alfa-epbx multiple-dose vial while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Use an effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant during treatment. If you think you have become pregnant while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away.

Epoetin alfa-epbx multiple-dose vial contains benzyl alcohol, which may cause serious reactions to newborn or premature babies. Discuss this with your doctor if you are concerned.

This medicine may increase your risk of having blood clots. This is more likely in patients who use high doses of this medicine, or who use this medicine before major surgery. If you have chest pain, trouble breathing, or pain, redness, or swelling in your arms or legs while using this medicine, call your doctor right away. If you are getting kidney dialysis treatments, tell your doctor right away if you notice blood clots at your injection site. Your doctor may give you a blood thinner before surgery to help prevent blood clots.

When used in patients with certain types of cancer (eg, breast, cervix, lymphoid, lung, head, or neck cancer), this medicine has shortened survival time and worsened the tumor or cancer in some patients. If you are concerned about this, talk with your doctor.

This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema. These can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after using this medicine.

Serious skin reactions (eg, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis) can occur with this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you have blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, chills, cough, diarrhea, itching, joint or muscle pain, red irritated eyes, red skin lesions, often with a purple center, sore throat, sores, ulcers, or white spots in the mouth of on the lips, or unusual tiredness or weakness.

Many people with kidney problems need to be on a special diet. Also, people with high blood pressure (which may be caused by kidney disease or by epoetin treatment) may need to be on a special diet or to take medicine to keep their blood pressure under control. After their anemia has been corrected, some people feel so much better that they want to eat more than before. To keep your kidney disease or your high blood pressure from getting worse, it is very important that you or your child follow your special diet and take your medicines regularly, even if you are feeling better.
