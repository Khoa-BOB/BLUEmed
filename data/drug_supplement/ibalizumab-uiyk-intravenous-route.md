## Description

Ibalizumab-uiyk injection is used together with other medicines for the treatment of the infection caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in patients who have received anti-HIV medicines that did not work well, who are resistant to many antiretroviral medicines, or who are failing their current antiretroviral treatment. HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).

Ibalizumab-uiyk injection will not cure or prevent HIV infection or AIDS, however, it helps keep HIV from reproducing and appears to slow down the destruction of the immune system.

People who receive this medicine may continue to have the problems usually related to AIDS or HIV disease.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.
