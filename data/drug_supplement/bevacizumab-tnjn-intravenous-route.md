Bevacizumab-tnjn injection is also used together with other medicines (eg, carboplatin and paclitaxel) to treat nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has spread, come back, or cannot be removed by surgery. It is also used to treat a type of brain tumor called glioblastoma that keeps coming back (recurrent).

It is also used in combination with other medicines (eg, paclitaxel and cisplatin, or paclitaxel and topotecan) to treat patients with cervical cancer that keeps coming back, or has spread to other parts of the body.

Bevacizumab-tnjn is an antineoplastic that helps the body fight cancer. It prevents the growth of certain types of blood vessels to cancer cells. This helps decrease the growth of cancer cells by starving them of the nutrients they need to grow.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.
