## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Ibrance

## Description

Palbociclib is used to treat hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER-2 negative advanced or metastatic (cancer that has spread) breast cancer. This medicine is used in combination with an aromatase inhibitor (eg, letrozole) as first hormonal based treatment or with fulvestrant in patients with disease progression following hormonal treatment.

Palbociclib is also used in combination with other medicines (eg, inavolisib, fulvestrant) to treat hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER-2 negative, and PIK3CA-mutated locally advanced or metastatic (cancer that has spread) breast cancer in patients with disease progression during or after hormonal treatment.

Palbociclib belongs to the group of medicines called antineoplastics. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal cells may also be affected by the medicine, other unwanted effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
- Capsule
