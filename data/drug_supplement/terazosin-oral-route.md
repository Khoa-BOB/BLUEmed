# Terazosin (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Hytrin

Tezruly

## Description

Terazosin is used to treat men who have symptoms of an enlarged prostate gland, which is also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). When the prostate gland gets larger, certain muscles in the gland get in the way of the tube that drains urine from the bladder. This can cause problems with urinating, such as a need to urinate often, a weak stream when urinating, or a feeling of not being able to empty the bladder completely.

Terazosin is also used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure.

This medicine is an alpha-blocker. It works by relaxing the blood vessels so that blood passes through them more easily. As a result, the heart beats slower and decreases the blood pressure. When the blood pressure is lowered, the amount of blood and oxygen is increased to the heart. It also helps relax the muscles in the prostate gland and the opening of the bladder. This may help increase the flow of urine or decrease symptoms.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Solution
- Capsule
