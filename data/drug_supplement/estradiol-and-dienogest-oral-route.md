# Estradiol and dienogest (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Natazia

## Description

Estradiol valerate and dienogest combination is used to prevent pregnancy. It is a birth control pill that contains two types of hormones, estrogens and progestins and, when taken properly, prevents pregnancy. It works by stopping a woman's egg from fully developing each month. The egg can no longer accept a sperm and fertilization (pregnancy) is prevented.

Estradiol valerate and dienogest combination is also used to treat heavy menstrual bleeding that is not caused by any diagnosed conditions of the uterus (womb) in women who choose to use birth control pills.

No contraceptive method is 100 percent effective. Birth control methods such as having surgery to become sterile or not having sex are more effective. Discuss with your doctor your options for birth control.

Estradiol valerate and dienogest combination does not prevent HIV/AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases. It will not help as emergency contraception, such as after unprotected sexual contact.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
