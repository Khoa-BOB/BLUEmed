## Description

Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (tetanus toxoid conjugate) is an active immunizing agent that is used to prevent infection caused by the Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) bacteria. The vaccine works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease.

Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine is prepared by adding a diphtheria, meningococcal, or tetanus-related substance to the process. However, this vaccine does not take the place of the regular vaccines for diphtheria, tetanus, or meningococcus that children and adults should receive. All of the haemophilus b conjugate vaccines work the same way , but they may be given at different ages or different schedules.

Infections with Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) bacteria can cause life-threatening illnesses, such as meningitis (a brain disease), epiglottitis (a throat disease that can cause suffocation), pericarditis (a heart disease), pneumonia (a lung disease), and septic arthritis (a bone and joint disease). Hib meningitis may cause death or leave the child with serious and permanent damage, such as intellectual disability, deafness, epilepsy, or partial blindness.

Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine is recommended for all children 2 months to 5 years of age (up to the 6th birthday).

The Hiberix® vaccine is used as a booster dose for children who have already received the primary series with a haemophilus b conjugate vaccine. The vaccine will "boost" or increase the protection that the child had from an earlier dose.

This vaccine is to be administered only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Powder for Solution
- Powder for Suspension
- Solution

## Proper Use

A nurse or other trained health professional will give your child this vaccine in a medical facility. It is given as a shot into a muscle.

The exact schedule for your child's vaccines will vary depending on the brand of medicine used and your child's age at the time of the first dose. In general, your child will receive the first dose at 2 to 6 months of age, followed by 2 more doses at least 8 weeks apart. Your child will usually receive a booster dose at 15 to 18 months of age, although he or she can receive this medicine up until the age of 5 years.

It is important that your child receive all of the doses of the vaccine in this series. Try to keep all of your scheduled appointments. If your child does miss a dose of this vaccine, make another appointment as soon as possible.

Your child may receive other vaccines at the same time as this one, but in a different body area. You should receive information sheets about all of the vaccines your child receives. Make sure you understand all of the information that is given to you.

## Precautions

It is very important that your child return to your doctor’s office at the right time for each dose . Be sure to notify your doctor of any unwanted effects that occur after your child receives this vaccine.

This vaccine may interfere with laboratory tests that check for Hib disease. Make sure your doctor knows that your child received the vaccine if a severe infection occurs during the 1 to 2 weeks after the vaccine is given.

The vaccine syringe and vial stopper may contain dry natural rubber(a derivative of latex), which may cause an allergic reaction in patients who are sensitive to latex. Tell your doctor if your child has a latex allergy before receiving this medicine.
