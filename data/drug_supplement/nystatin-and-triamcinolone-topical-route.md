## Description

Nystatin and triamcinolone combination contains an antifungal and a corticosteroid (cortisone-like medicine).

Antifungals are used to treat infections caused by a fungus. They work by killing the fungus or preventing its growth. This medicine will not work for other kinds of infections. Corticosteroids belong to the family of medicines called steroids. They are used to help relieve redness, swelling, itching, and other discomfort of many skin problems.

This medicine is used to treat certain fungus infections, such as Candida (Monilia), and to help relieve the discomfort of the infection.

Topical corticosteroids may rarely cause some serious side effects. Some of the side effects may be more likely to occur in children. Before using this medicine in children, be sure to talk to your doctor about these problems, as well as the good this medicine may do.

Nystatin and triamcinolone combination is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Cream

Check with your doctor before using this medicine on any other skin problems. It should not be used on bacterial or virus infections. Also, it should only be used on certain fungus infections of the skin.

Apply a thin layer of this medicine to the affected area and rub in gently and thoroughly.

The use of any kind of airtight covering over this medicine may increase absorption of the medicine and the chance of irritation and other side effects.
