# Typhoid vaccine, inactivated (subcutaneous route, injection route)

## Description

Typhoid fever is a serious disease that can cause death. It is caused by a germ called Salmonella typhi and is spread most often through infected food or water. Typhoid may also be spread by close person-to-person contact with infected persons (such as occurs with persons living in the same household). Some infected persons do not appear to be sick, but they can still spread the germ to others.

Typhoid fever is rare in the U.S. and in other areas of the world that have good water and sewage (waste) systems. However, it is a problem in parts of the world that do not have such systems. If you are traveling to certain countries, or to remote, out-of-the-way areas, typhoid vaccine will help protect you from typhoid fever. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) currently recommend caution in the following areas of the world:

- Africa
- Asia
- Latin America

Typhoid vaccine given by injection helps prevent typhoid fever but does not provide 100% protection. Therefore, it is very important to avoid infected persons and food and water that may be infected, even if you have received the vaccine.

To get the best possible protection against typhoid, you should complete the vaccine dosing schedule at least 1 week before you travel to areas where you may be exposed to typhoid.

Also, if you will be traveling regularly to parts of the world where typhoid is a problem, you should get a booster (repeat) dose of the vaccine every 3 years.

Typhoid vaccine is to be used only by or under the supervision of a doctor.

## Before Using

In deciding to use a vaccine, the risks of taking the vaccine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this vaccine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Typhoid vaccine is not recommended for infants and children up to 6 months of age. For infants and children 6 months of age and over, this vaccine is not expected to cause different side effects or problems than it does in adults.

### Geriatric

Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults. Although there is no specific information comparing use of typhoid vaccine in the elderly with use in other age groups, this vaccine is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in older people than it does in younger adults.

Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.

The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.

## Side Effects

Along with its needed effects, a vaccine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention. It is very important that you tell your doctor about any side effects that occur after a dose of typhoid vaccine, even though the side effect may have gone away without treatment. Some types of side effects may mean that you should not receive any more doses of typhoid vaccine.
