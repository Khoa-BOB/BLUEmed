# Cabazitaxel (intravenous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Jevtana

## Description

Cabazitaxel injection is given together with a steroid medicine (eg, prednisone) to treat men with metastatic (cancer that has already spread) castration-resistant prostate cancer (prostate cancer that cannot be treated by surgery or medicines that lower testosterone). It is used in patients who have already been treated with other medicines (eg, docetaxel) that did not work well.

Cabazitaxel belongs to the group of medicines called antineoplastics (cancer medicines). It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected, other unwanted effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Solution

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of cabazitaxel injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

### Geriatric

However, elderly patients are more likely to have unwanted side effects (including febrile neutropenia), which may require caution in patients receiving cabazitaxel.
