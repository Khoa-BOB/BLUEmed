## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of Arynta™ to treat ADHD in children 6 years of age and older. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 6 years of age.

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of Vynase® to treat ADHD in children younger than 6 years of age. However, children are more likely to have unwanted effects (eg, weight loss, slow growth). Use in children younger than 6 years of age is not recommended.

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate to treat binge eating disorder in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving lisdexamfetamine dimesylate.
