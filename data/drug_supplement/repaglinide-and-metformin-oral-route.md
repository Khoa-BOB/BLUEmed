# Repaglinide and metformin (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

PrandiMet

## Description

Repaglinide and metformin combination is used to treat high blood sugar levels caused by a type of diabetes mellitus (sugar diabetes) called type 2 diabetes. It is used together with a proper diet and exercise to help control blood sugar levels in patients who are already treated with meglitinide and metformin combination, or in patients who have been taking meglitinide or metformin but did not work well.

Repaglinide causes your pancreas to release more insulin into the blood stream. Metformin reduces the absorption of sugar from the stomach, reduces the release of stored sugar from the liver, and helps your body use sugar better.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
