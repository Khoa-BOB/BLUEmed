# Losartan and hydrochlorothiazide (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Hyzaar

## Description

Losartan and hydrochlorothiazide combination is used alone or together with other medicines to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure may reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks.

Losartan and hydrochlorothiazide combination is also used to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with high blood pressure and enlargement of the heart.

Losartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). It works by blocking a substance in the body that causes the blood vessels to tighten. Losartan relaxes the blood vessels and lowers the blood pressure. A lower blood pressure will increase the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.

Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic (water pill) . It reduces the amount of water in the body by increasing the flow of urine, which helps lower the blood pressure.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
