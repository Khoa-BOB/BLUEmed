# Colestipol (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Colestid

## Description

Colestipol is used to lower high cholesterol levels in the blood. This may help prevent medical problems caused by cholesterol clogging the blood vessels.

Colestipol works by attaching to certain substances in the intestine. Since colestipol is not absorbed into the body, these substances also pass out of the body without being absorbed.

Colestipol may also be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.

Colestipol is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Powder for Suspension
- Tablet
