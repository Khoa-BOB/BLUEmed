# Canagliflozin (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Invokana

## Description

Canagliflozin is used together with proper diet and exercise to treat type 2 diabetes. It is also used to lower the risk of heart attack, stroke, or death in patients with type 2 diabetes and heart or blood vessel disease. This medicine works in the kidneys to prevent absorption of glucose (blood sugar). This helps lower the blood sugar level. Canagliflozin does not help patients who have insulin-dependent or type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetic patients must use insulin injections.

Canagliflozin is also used to lower the risk of end stage kidney disease, worsening of kidney function, and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic kidney disease with a certain amount of protein in the urine.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
