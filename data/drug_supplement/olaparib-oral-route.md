Your doctor will test for the presence of this gene. It is used in patients who have received complete or partial treatment with platinum-based cancer medicines.

Olaparib is used together with bevacizumab as maintenance treatment in patients with advanced ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer with a certain type of abnormal BRCA gene or a positive tumor test for genomic instability called HRD. Your doctor will test for the presence of this gene. It is used in patients who have received complete or partial treatment with platinum-based cancer medicines.

Olaparib is also used to treat ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer with a certain type of inherited (germline) or acquired (somatic) abnormal BRCA gene that has come back. Your doctor will test for the presence of this gene. It is used in patients who have received complete or partial treatment with platinum-based cancer medicines.

Olaparib is also used to treat HER2-negative early breast cancer in patients who have been treated with other cancer medicines. It is used if the cancer cells have the germline BRCA mutations. Your doctor will use a special test to look for these mutations. It is given to patients after surgery to remove the tumor.

Olaparib is also used to treat HER2-negative metastatic (cancer that has spread) breast cancer in patients who have been treated with other cancer medicines. It is used if the cancer cells have the germline BRCA mutations. Your doctor will use a special test to look for these mutations.

It is used if the cancer cells have a certain type of inherited (germline) or acquired (somatic) abnormal HRR gene. Your doctor will test for the presence of this gene.
