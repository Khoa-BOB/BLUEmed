## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Studies of this medicine have been done only in adult patients, and there is no specific information comparing use of podofilox in children with use in other age groups.

### Geriatric

Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing use of podofilox in the elderly with use in other age groups.

### Breastfeeding

There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.

### Drug Interactions

Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.

### Other Interactions

Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.  Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur.  Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.

## Proper Use

A paper with information for the patient will be given to you with your filled prescription and will provide many details concerning the use of podofilox. Read this paper carefully and ask your health care professional if you need additional information.

Also, keep podofilox away from the eyes and mucous membranes, such as the inside of the penis, rectum, or vagina. This medicine may cause severe irritation. If you get this medicine in your eyes or on one of these areas, immediately flush the area with water for 15 minutes.

Use podofilox only as directed, no more than 3 days a week and no more than 4 treatment cycles. Do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may increase the chances that this medicine is absorbed into the body and that side effects could occur.

Do not apply the medicine to any other wart until you discuss it with your doctor. The total dose of podofilox used on all warts should not exceed that which would cover an area measuring 1.6 square inches (10 square centimeters), about the size of a dollar coin.

To use:

- To apply the solution, use the applicators that come with the solution or a cotton-tipped applicator. To apply the gel, use a cotton-tipped applicator or your finger. Never reuse an applicator or dip a used applicator into the bottle.
- Apply podofilox only to the wart(s) discussed with your doctor.
- Podofilox can cause severe irritation of normal skin. If you get medicine on normal skin, wash it off immediately.
- Make sure the treated area is dry before allowing the treated skin to come in contact with normal, untreated skin.
- Immediately after applying this medicine, wash your hands to remove any medicine. Properly discard used applicator(s).
