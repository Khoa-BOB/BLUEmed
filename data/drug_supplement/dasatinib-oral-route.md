## Description

Dasatinib is used to treat Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia (Ph+ CML) in adults and children. It is also used to treat Ph+ CML and Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) in adults after other medicines (eg, imatinib) or treatments did not work well. Dasatinib is also used in combination with chemotherapy to treat newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL in children 1 year of age and older. Leukemia is a type of cancer where the body makes too many abnormal white blood cells. It belongs to the general group of medicines known as antineoplastics or cancer medicines. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body.

Dasatinib can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:

- If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor right away if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.
- Check with your doctor right away if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.
- Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.
- Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.
- Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.
- Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.

Dasatinib may cause fluid retention, including pleural effusion (fluid build-up around your lungs). Check with your doctor right away if you have a decrease in the amount of urine, noisy or rattling breathing, difficulty breathing, swelling of the fingers, hands, feet, or lower legs, trouble breathing, or weight gain.

Check with your doctor right away if you have chest discomfort or pain, decreased urine output, fast, irregular, or pounding heartbeat, swelling of the feet or lower legs, trouble breathing, or unusual tiredness or weakness. These could be symptoms of a serious heart or blood vessel problem (eg, heart attack, stroke).

Using this medicine may cause headache, muscle or joint pain, skin rash, or unusual tiredness or weakness. If these symptoms persist and become worse, check with your doctor.

This medicine may increase your risk of having a condition called pulmonary arterial hypertension (high blood pressure in the lungs). This may occur at anytime during treatment with this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you have trouble breathing, tiredness, or swelling all over your body (fluid retention).

Serious skin reactions (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme) can occur with this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you have blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, chills, cough, diarrhea, red irritated eyes, red skin lesions, often with a purple center, severe acne or skin rash, sore throat, sores, ulcers, or white spots in the mouth or on the lips, or unusual tiredness or weakness while you are using this medicine.

This medicine may cause a serious type of reaction called tumor lysis syndrome. Your doctor may give you a medicine to help prevent this. Call your doctor right away if you have a decrease or change in urine amount, joint pain, stiffness, or swelling, lower back, side, or stomach pain, a rapid weight gain, swelling of the feet or lower legs, or unusual tiredness or weakness.

This medicine may cause slowed growth and development in children. Your child's doctor may want to monitor their weight and growth regularly. Talk to your child's doctor if you have concerns.
