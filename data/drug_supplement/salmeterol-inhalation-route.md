## Description

Salmeterol is used together with other medicines (eg, inhaled corticosteroids) to control the symptoms of asthma and prevent bronchospasm in patients with asthma. When used regularly every day, inhaled salmeterol decreases the number and severity of asthma attacks. However, it will not relieve an asthma attack that has already started.

Salmeterol is also used to treat air flow blockage and prevent the worsening of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It is also used to prevent wheezing caused by exercise (exercise-induced bronchospasm or EIB).

Salmeterol is a long-acting bronchodilator. Bronchodilators are medicines that are breathed in through the mouth to open up the bronchial tubes (air passages) in the lungs. They relieve cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, and troubled breathing by increasing the flow of air through the bronchial tubes.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Powder

For relief of an asthma attack that has already started, you should use another medicine. If you do not have another medicine to use for an attack or if you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.

Use this medicine only as directed by your doctor . Do not use more of it and do not use it more often than your doctor ordered. Also, do not stop using this medicine without first telling your doctor. To do so may increase the chance of having breathing problems.

If you do not understand the directions or you are not sure how to use the Diskus®, ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you what to do. Also, ask your doctor to check regularly how you use the Diskus® to make sure you are using it properly.
