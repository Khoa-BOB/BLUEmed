## Description

Pneumococcal 13-valent diphtheria conjugate vaccine is an active immunizing agent used to prevent infection by pneumococcal bacteria. It works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease.

Pneumococcal infection can cause serious problems, such as pneumonia, which affects the lungs; meningitis, which affects the brain; and bacteremia, which is a severe infection in the blood. Pneumococcal infection is also an important cause of ear infections in children.

Unless otherwise contraindicated, immunization (vaccination) against pneumococcal disease is recommended for infants and young children 6 weeks to 5 years of age (prior to the 6th birthday), children 6 to 17 years of age (prior to the 18th birthday), or to adults 18 years of age and older.

For infants and young children, immunization requires 1 to 4 doses of the vaccine, depending on the age at the first dose. This vaccine can be given at the same time as other routine vaccinations.

This vaccine is to be given only by or under the supervision of your doctor.

## Before Using

In deciding to use a vaccine, the risks of taking the vaccine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this vaccine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

The pneumococcal 13-valent diphtheria conjugate vaccine is generally well-tolerated and effective in children. The safety and effectiveness in children younger than 6 weeks of age have not been established.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of pneumococcal 13-valent diphtheria conjugate vaccine in the elderly.

### Breastfeeding

There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.

### Drug Interactions

Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving this vaccine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.

### Other Interactions

Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.  Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur.  Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.

### Other Medical Problems

The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this vaccine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:

- Apnea in premature babies (breathing stops for short periods)—Use with caution. May make this condition worse.

- Immune system problems (eg, cancer, HIV, kidney or spleen problems, stem cell transplant)—This vaccine may not work as well in patients with a weak immune system.

## Proper Use

A nurse or other trained health professional will give you or your child this vaccine. This vaccine is given as a shot into one of the muscles, usually in the thigh or upper arm.

For infants and young children 6 weeks to 5 years of age (prior to the 6th birthday) : This vaccine is usually given as 4 separate shots over several months. Your child's doctor will tell you the correct number of shots that are needed and the schedule to be followed for the vaccine.

For children 6 to 17 years of age (prior to 18th birthday) : This vaccine is given as a single dose. If your child just recently received a dose of this vaccine, the next dose should be given at least 8 weeks later.

For adults 18 years of age and older : This vaccine is given as a single dose.

It is very important for your child to receive all of the shots for the vaccine.

The vaccine needs to be given on a fixed schedule. Try to keep all of the scheduled appointments. If your child misses a dose, call your child’s doctor for another appointment.

## Precautions

It is very important that your child return to your doctor’s office at the right time for all of the doses. Be sure to notify your doctor of any side effects that occur after your child receives this vaccine.

This vaccine may cause a serious type of allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you or your child has a rash, itching, swelling of the tongue and throat, or trouble breathing after receiving the vaccine.

The pneumococcal 13-valent diphtheria conjugate vaccine will not protect you or your child against all types of pneumococcal infections. It will also not treat an active infection.

Make sure the doctor knows if you are receiving a treatment or using a medicine that causes a weak immune system. This includes radiation treatment, steroid medicines (eg, hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, prednisolone, prednisone), or cancer medicines. .
