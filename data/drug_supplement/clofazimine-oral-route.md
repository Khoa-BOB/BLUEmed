## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

Using this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. It may also cause birth defects if the father is using it when his sexual partner becomes pregnant. Female patients should use effective birth control during treatment with this medicine and for at least 4 months after the last dose. Male patients who have female partners should use effective birth control during treatment with this medicine and for at least 4 months after the last dose. If you think you have become pregnant while using this medicine, tell your doctor right away.

Your doctor will give you a pregnancy test before starting treatment with this medicine to make sure you are not pregnant.

If your symptoms do not improve within 1 to 3 months, or if they become worse, check with your doctor.

This medicine may be stored in the different organs of the body (eg, lymph nodes, bowels, spleen, liver) as crystals. When stored in the bowels, this may lead to bowel blockage or stomach or bowel bleeding. This medicine may also cause splenic infarction, where the spleen does not get enough oxygen. Check with your doctor right away if you have nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, black or bloody stools, stomach pain, or pain spreading to the left shoulder.

Contact your doctor right away if you have any changes to your heart rhythm. You might feel dizzy or faint, or you might have a fast, pounding, or uneven heartbeat. Make sure your doctor knows if you had a heart rhythm problem, such as QT prolongation.

Clofazimine may cause orange-pink to brownish-black discoloration of the skin within a few weeks after you start using it. Because of the skin discoloration, some patients may become depressed. It may also cause your sweat, tears, spit, urine, stools, and the whites of your eyes to turn red or brownish-black in color. The discoloration will go away when you stop using this medicine. However, it may take several months or years for the skin to clear up completely. If skin discoloration causes you to feel very depressed or to have thoughts of suicide, check with your doctor right away.

Clofazimine may cause dry, rough, itchy, or scaly skin. You may use a skin cream, lotion, or oil may help treat this problem.

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
