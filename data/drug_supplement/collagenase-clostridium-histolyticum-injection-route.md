Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.

### Other Interactions

Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.  Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur.  Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.

## Proper Use

A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine in a hospital. This medicine is given through a needle placed into the cord that is causing your finger to bend or into the plaque that is causing your penis to curve.

This medicine should come with a Medication Guide. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.

If you are receiving this medicine for Dupuytren's contracture :

- Your affected hand will be wrapped with a bandage after receiving the injection. Avoid moving and using your treated finger.
- Your doctor may give you 2 injections if you have more than one contracture in the same hand.
- It is very important that you return to your doctor 1 to 3 days after receiving the injection. This will allow your doctor to see the injected hand, and to do a possible finger extension procedure to disrupt the cord.
- It is very important that you elevate the fingers of the injected hand until bedtime to prevent swelling. Do not try to move or massage the cord, bend, or extend the fingers of the injected hand, or do heavy activity using your hand to prevent more injury.
- Your doctor may put a splint on your hand after giving this medicine. Wear the splint at bedtime for up to 4 months. Do finger bending and extending exercises as instructed by your doctor.

- This medicine is available only through a restricted program called Xiaflex® REMS Program. Doctors who are enrolled in the restricted program can write a prescription for this medicine.

- This medicine is given as part of a treatment cycle. In a treatment cycle, you will receive an injection followed by a second injection 1 to 3 days later.
- It is very important that you return to your doctor 1 to 3 days after your second injection. This will allow your doctor to do a manual procedure to stretch and help straighten your penis.
- Do not have sexual intercourse or have any sexual activity between the first and second injections of a treatment cycle, and for at least 4 weeks after the second injection of a treatment cycle and after pain and swelling has gone away.
