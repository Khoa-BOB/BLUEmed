## Description

Eplerenone belongs to the general class of medicines called antihypertensives. It is used alone or together with other medicines to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). This medicine is also used to treat congestive heart failure (CHF) after a heart attack.

High blood pressure adds to the work load of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Hypertension may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
