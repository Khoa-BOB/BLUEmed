## Description

Albumin (human) injection is used to treat low blood volume (hypovolemia). It is also used to treat low albumin levels in the blood (hypoalbuminemia) caused by: not enough albumin produced by the body (eg, malnutrition, burns, major injury, infections), excessive breakdown of albumin (eg, burns, major injury, pancreatitis), loss of albumin from the body (eg, bleeding, excessive kidney excretion, burn exudates), or redistribution of albumin from the body (eg, major surgery, inflammatory conditions).

Albumin (human) injection is also used to treat hypoalbuminemia in patients with severe injuries, infections, or pancreatitis (swelling of the pancreas) that cannot be quickly reversed and when nutritional supplements have been given but did not work well. It is also used together with crystalloid treatment to correct lower osmotic pressure in the blood and to replace protein loss caused by severe burns after the first 24 hours.

Albumin (human) injection is used as a priming fluid during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.

Flexbumin® 25% is used when hypovolemia is long-standing and hypoalbuminemia exists along with enough hydration, or fluid swelling (edema). It is also used together with other medicines (eg, water pill) to treat fluid swelling in the lungs (interstitial pulmonary edema) and hypoproteinemia (low protein levels in the blood) in patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Flexbumin® 25% is also used to treat swelling in patients with severe nephrosis who are receiving steroids or a water pill. It is also used to treat hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) in babies.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.
