# Meperidine and promethazine (injection route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Mepergan

## Description

Meperidine and promethazine combination injection is used to treat pain severe enough to require opioid treatment and when other pain medicines did not work well enough or cannot be tolerated. It is also used with other medicines just before or during an operation to help the anesthetic (numbing medicine) work better.

Meperidine belongs to the group of medicines called narcotic analgesics (pain medicines). It acts in the central nervous system (CNS) or brain to relieve pain.

Promethazine is an antihistamine. It works by preventing the effects of a substance called histamine, which is produced by the body. Histamine can cause itching, sneezing, runny nose, and watery eyes. It can sometimes close up the bronchial tubes (air passages of the lungs) and make breathing difficult.

When meperidine is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.
