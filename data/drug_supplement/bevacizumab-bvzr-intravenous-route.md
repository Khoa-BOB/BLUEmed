Bevacizumab-bvzr injection is also used together with other medicines (eg, interferon alfa) to treat patients with metastatic kidney cancer. It is also used in combination with other medicines (eg, paclitaxel and cisplatin, or paclitaxel and topotecan) to treat patients with cervical cancer that is continuing, keeps coming back, or has spread to other parts of the body.

Bevacizumab-bvzr injection is also used in combination with other medicines (eg, paclitaxel, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, topotecan, carboplatin and paclitaxel, or carboplatin and gemcitabine followed by Zirabev™ alone) to treat patients with platinum-resistant, platinum-sensitive, recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer with or without having previous surgery or who have received 2 previous treatments.

Bevacizumab is an antineoplastic that helps the body fight cancer. It prevents the growth of certain types of blood vessels to cancer cells. This helps to decrease the growth of cancer cells by starving the cells of nutrients that are needed to grow.
