Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of patisiran injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of this medicine than younger adults.

In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.

### Other Interactions

Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.

## Proper Use

A doctor or other trained health professional will give you this medicine. It is given through a needle that is placed into one of your veins.

You may also receive other medicines (including allergy medicine, fever medicine, steroids) at least 60 minutes before starting treatment to help prevent possible unwanted effects during the injection. You may also be given vitamin A supplements as needed.

## Precautions
