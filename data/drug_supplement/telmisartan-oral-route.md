# Telmisartan (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Micardis

## Description

Telmisartan is used alone or together with other medicines to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure can reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks.

Telmisartan is also used to lower the risk of heart attacks or stroke in patients 55 years of age and older who have diabetes or heart problems.

Telmisartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). It works by blocking a substance in the body that causes blood vessels to tighten. As a result, telmisartan relaxes the blood vessels. This lowers blood pressure and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
