# Toremifene (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Fareston

## Description

Toremifene is used to treat metastatic breast cancer (cancer that has spread) that is hormone-receptor positive in women who have already stopped menstruating (postmenopausal).

Many of the breast cancer tumors will grow when estrogen is available in the body. This medicine blocks the effects of the estrogen hormone. As a result, the amount of estrogen that the tumor is exposed to is reduced, which will limit the growth of the tumor.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
