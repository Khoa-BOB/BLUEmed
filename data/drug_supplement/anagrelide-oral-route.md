## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check you or your child's progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood tests are needed to check for unwanted effects. You will also need to have an ECG test (electrocardiogram) to check your heart rhythm.

This medicine may cause unwanted effects on the heart. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have chest pain, tightness, or discomfort, decreased urine output, dilated neck veins, extreme fatigue, a fast, pounding, or uneven heartbeat or pulse, pain or discomfort in the arms, jaw, back or neck, nausea or vomiting, sweating, swelling of the face, fingers, feet, or lower legs, trouble breathing, or weight gain. These could be symptoms of a serious heart problem.

This medicine may also increase your risk of bleeding. Check with your doctor immediately if you or your child notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.

Contact your doctor right away if you have any changes to your heart rhythm. You might feel dizzy or faint, or you might have a fast, pounding, or uneven heartbeat. Make sure your doctor knows if you or anyone in your family has ever had a heart rhythm problem such as QT prolongation.

This medicine may cause lung problems, including interstitial lung disease or pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the lungs).

Check with your doctor right away if you have new or worsening cough, fever, or trouble breathing.
