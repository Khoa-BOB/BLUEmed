# Amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Moduretic 5-50

## Description

Amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide combination is used alone or with other medicines to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled.

This medicine is also used to treat water retention (edema) in patients with congestive heart failure.

Amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide are both diuretic medicines (water pills). They reduce the amount of water in the body by increasing the flow of urine, which helps lower the blood pressure. Amiloride keeps your body from losing too much potassium when urine flow is increased.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
