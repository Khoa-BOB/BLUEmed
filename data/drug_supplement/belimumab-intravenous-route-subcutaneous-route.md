You should not receive this medicine if you are also using other biologic treatments or cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan®). Using these medicines together may increase your chance for more serious side effects .

This medicine may cause serious infections (eg, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, cellulitis, and bronchitis). Check with your doctor right away if you have bladder pain, bloody or cloudy urine, chest pain, cough, cough producing mucus, difficult, burning, or painful urination, fever or chills, frequent urge to urinate, itching, pain, redness, swelling, tenderness, or warmth of the skin, lower back or side pain, sneezing, sore throat, trouble breathing, or chest tightness.

This medicine may increase your risk of developing infections, including a serious brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Avoid being near people who are sick and wash your hands often. Check with your doctor right away if you have a fever, chills, a cough that won't go away, flu-like symptoms, a headache, night sweats, or weight loss. Tell your doctor if you have balance problems, confusion, difficulty talking or walking, dizziness, memory loss, or vision changes.
