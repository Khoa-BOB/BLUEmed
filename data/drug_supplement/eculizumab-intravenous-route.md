## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of eculizumab injection to treat atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome in children and to treat generalized myasthenia gravis in children 6 years of age and older. However, safety and efficacy of eculizumab injection to treat other conditions have not been established in children.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of eculizumab injection in the elderly.

### Breastfeeding

There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.

In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.

## Proper Use

A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine. This medicine is given through an IV catheter that is placed into one of your veins. It must be injected slowly, so your IV will need to stay in place for at least 35 minutes in adults and 1 to 4 hours in children.

It is very important that you understand the requirements of the Ultomiris® and Soliris® REMS program, and become familiar with the Soliris® medication guide. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions. Ask your pharmacist for the medication guide if you do not have one.

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

Eculizumab may increase your chance of having serious infections, including a meningococcal infection. Avoid people who are sick or have infections. Tell your doctor right away if you develop headaches, nausea, vomiting, fever, a stiff neck or back, a rash, confusion, muscle aches, or if your eyes have become sensitive to light. Make sure you have received a vaccine to prevent meningococcus infections at least 2 weeks before you receive this medicine. You may also be given antibiotic medicines to prevent infections if you are to use this medicine right away. If you have already received the meningococcal vaccine in the past, your doctor will decide if you need another dose.

Ask your doctor for a patient safety card. This card will list the symptoms of meningococcus infections and what to do if you have them. Carry the card with you at all times during treatment and for 3 months after your last dose. You will need to show the card to any doctor who treats you.

For patients with PNH: When this medicine is stopped you could have red blood cell destruction or breakdown (hemolysis). Your doctor will need to monitor you closely for at least 8 weeks after you stop using this medicine. Be sure to keep all appointments.

For patients with aHUS: Your doctor may also need to check for blood clots in your small blood vessels, called thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) for at least 12 weeks after stopping treatment with this medicine. The signs and symptoms of TMA include chest pain, difficulty with breathing, mental depression or anxiety, or seizures. Call your doctor right away if you notice any of these signs and symptoms.

Eculizumab may cause infusion-related reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you start to have a fever, chills or shaking, dizziness, chest pain, trouble breathing, itching or rash, lightheadedness, fainting, or swelling of the face, tongue, or throat after receiving this medicine.

Tell your doctor if you are also receiving other procedures (eg, plasma exchange, plasmapheresis, fresh frozen plasma infusion) or medicines for myasthenia gravis.
