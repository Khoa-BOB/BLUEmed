This medicine may increase your risk of developing infections, including a rare and serious brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). This is more likely to occur if you have had JCV infection, have been receiving natalizumab-sztn for a long time (longer than 2 years), or if you have been using medicine that weakens your immune system (eg, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, mercaptopurine, methotrexate, mitoxantrone, mycophenolate mofetil, or steroid medicine) before receiving this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you have vision changes, loss of coordination, clumsiness, memory loss, difficulty speaking or understanding what others say, or weak legs.

This medicine may cause a rare condition called immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). This may occur after a person stops receiving this medicine after developing PML during treatment. Tell your doctor right away if you have an inflammatory reaction to an infection that includes mild burning, stinging, or tingling of the skin, or a feeling of heat, redness, or swelling of the skin.
