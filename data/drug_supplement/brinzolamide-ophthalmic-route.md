To use the eye drops:

- Wash your hands with soap and water.
- Shake the eye drops well just before each use.
- Lie down or tilt your head back. With your index finger, pull down the lower lid of your eye to form a pocket.
- Hold the dropper close to your eye with the other hand. Drop the correct number of drops into the pocket made between your lower lid and eyeball.
- Gently close your eyes. Place your index finger over the inner corner of your eye for 1 minute.
- If you think you did not get the drop of medicine into your eye properly, repeat the process with another drop.
- Do not rinse or wipe the dropper or allow it to touch anything, including your eye.
- Put the cap on the bottle right away.
- Wash your hands after using the eye drops to remove any medicine.
- Never touch the applicator tip to any surface, including the eye, and keep the container tightly closed. This will keep the medicine as germ-free as possible.

If your doctor ordered two different eye drops to be used together, wait at least 10 minutes between the times you apply the medicines. This will help to keep the second medicine from “washing out” the first one.
