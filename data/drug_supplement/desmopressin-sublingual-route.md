# Desmopressin (sublingual route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Nocdurna

## Description

Desmopressin is used to treat patients who awaken 2 or more times at night to urinate caused by nocturnal polyuria, a condition wherein your body makes too much urine at night. Your doctor may tell you to collect and measure your urine and the times that you urinate for 24 hours to determine if you have nocturnal polyuria.

Desmopressin is similar to a hormone that is produced in the body. It acts on the kidneys to reduce the flow of urine.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:
