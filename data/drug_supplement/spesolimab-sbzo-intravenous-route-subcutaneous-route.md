150 mg/mL Prefilled syringe and Vial : A doctor or other trained health professional will give you this medicine in a medical facility. The vial is given through an IV catheter that is placed into one of your veins. It must be given slowly, so the IV will have to remain in place for at least 90 minutes. The 150 mg/mL prefilled syringe is given as a shot under your skin, usually on the stomach or thighs.

150 mg/mL or 300 mg/2 mL Prefilled syringe : You may also be taught how to give your medicine at home. It is usually given as a shot under the skin of your stomach or thigh. Make sure you understand all instructions before you give yourself an injection. Do not use more medicine or use it more often than your doctor tells you to.

This medicine comes with a Medication Guide and patient instructions. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have questions.

Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot, at least 1 inch away from the last injection site. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. Do not inject into skin areas that are red, bruised, tender, damaged, hard, or areas with scars. Do not inject an area near your waistline or belly button.

Allow the prefilled syringe to warm to room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes before using it. Do not warm it in any other way (eg, microwave, hot water, or direct sunlight).

To use the prefilled syringe :

- Wash your hands with soap and water before and after using this medicine.
- Do not remove the needle cap.
- Check the liquid in the syringe. It should be clear and colorless to slightly brownish-yellow. Do not use it if it is cloudy, discolored, or has flakes or large or colored particles in it. Do not use the syringe if it is damaged, dropped, broken, leaking, or has cracks.
- Hold the syringe by the finger grip with one hand. Using your other hand, pull the cap straight off. Do not pull on or hold the plunger rod. Do not twist the cap. Do not put the cap back on.
- Gently pinch the skin. Hold the syringe by the blue finger grip. Using a quick, "dart-like" motion, insert the needle into the pinched skin at a 45 degree angle. Do not move the needle.
- Use your thumb to slowly press down on the blue thumb pad to push the plunger rod inside the syringe body. Continue pressing the blue thumb pad until the plunger rod has moved all the way down.
- Make sure the blue thumb pad cannot be pressed any further so that the built-in safety cover can be activated. Check that the thumb pad springs back and that the needle is inside the safety cover to make sure you have received the full dose.
- Use a new needle and prefilled syringe each time you inject your medicine.
