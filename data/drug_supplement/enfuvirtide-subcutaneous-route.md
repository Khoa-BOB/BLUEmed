## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check you your child's progress at regular visits , especially during the first few weeks that you use this medicine. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for any unwanted effects.

This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing or swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after using this medicine.

This medicine may increase the risk of having pneumonia. This is more likely to occur if you smoke or have a history of lung disease. Check with your doctor right away if you have chest pain or tightness, cough, fever, chills, or troubled breathing.

This medicine can cause reactions at the injection site. Almost all people get injection site reactions with enfuvirtide. These reactions hurt and itch, and they are usually mild to moderate but can occasionally be severe. These reactions generally happen within the first week of treatment and as you keep using enfuvirtide. If the injection site nodules drain pus or cause redness that spreads or streaks from the sites, or you are worried about the reaction you are having, call your doctor right away.

Some people who have used Biojector® 2000 to inject this medicine have had shooting nerve pain and tingling lasting up to 6 months when injected close to large nerves or near joints, or had bleeding, bruising, or lumps. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about this.

Your immune system may get stronger when you start using HIV medicines. Tell your doctor right away if you notice any changes in your health. Sometimes the immune system will start to fight infections that were hidden in your body, such as pneumonia, herpes, or tuberculosis. Autoimmune disorders (eg, Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) may also occur.

This medicine may make you dizzy or drowsy. Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you .

This medicine does not decrease the risk of transmitting the HIV infection to others through sexual contact or by contaminated blood. Make sure you understand and practice safe sex, even if your partner also has HIV. Avoid sharing needles with anyone.

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
