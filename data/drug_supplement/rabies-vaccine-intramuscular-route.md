## Description

Rabies vaccine is an active immunizing agent used to prevent infection caused by the rabies virus. The vaccine works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the rabies virus.

Rabies vaccine is used in two ways. Rabies vaccine is given to persons who have been exposed (eg, by a bite, scratch, or lick) to an animal that is known, or thought, to have rabies. This is called post-exposure prophylaxis. Rabies vaccine may also be given ahead of time to persons who have a high risk of getting infected with rabies virus. These persons include veterinarians, animal handlers, or travelers who will spend more than 1 month in countries having a high rate of rabies infection, and persons who live, work, or take vacations in wild areas of the country where they are likely to come into contact with wild animals. This is called pre-exposure prophylaxis.

Rabies infection is a serious, and often fatal, infection. In the U.S., rabies in wild animals, especially raccoons, skunks, foxes, and bats, accounts for most cases of rabies passed on to humans, pets, and other domestic animals. In Canada, the animals most often infected with rabies are foxes, skunks, bats, dogs, and cats. Horses, swine, and cattle also have been known to become infected with rabies. In much of the rest of the world, including Latin America, Africa, and Asia, dogs account for most cases of rabies passed on to humans.

If you are being (or will be) treated for a possible rabies infection while traveling outside of the U.S. or Canada, contact your doctor as soon as you return to the U.S. or Canada, since it may be necessary for you to have additional treatment.

This vaccine is to be given only by or under the supervision of your doctor or other health care professional.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Powder for Suspension

## Proper Use

A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this vaccine in a medical facility. For older children and adults, it is given as a shot into one of your muscles. For babies and children, it is given as a shot in the thigh.

If you are a veterinarian, work with animals, or will be going to a country where rabies is common, you are at risk for exposure to the rabies virus. If you are getting the vaccine because you are at risk of being exposed to rabies, you will receive 3 doses on 3 different days within a 1-month period.

Patients who have not been exposed to rabies:

- Two-dose schedule: First dose is given at Day 0 and second dose is given at Day 7. You will receive a single dose of booster shot.
- Three-dose schedule: First dose is given at Day 0, second dose is given at Day 7, and third dose given at Day 21 or 28. You will receive a single dose of booster shot.

Patients who have been exposed to rabies:

- Patients who have received any rabies vaccine: Given in 2 doses 3 days apart (first dose at Day 0 and second dose at Day 3).
- Patients who have not received any rabies vaccine or have a weak immune system: Given in 5 doses (first dose at Day 0, second dose at Day 3, third dose at Day 7, fourth dose at Day 14, and fifth dose at Day 28). You will also receive a shot of rabies immune globulin.

In order for the rabies vaccine to work properly, it is very important that you do not miss any doses . Keep your appointments with your doctor.

### Missed Dose

Call your doctor or pharmacist for instructions.

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check you or your child's progress at regular visits to make sure that this vaccine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

This vaccine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, a fast heartbeat, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after receiving the vaccine.

This vaccine may cause serum sickness type reactions 2 to 21 days after receiving this vaccine. Check with your doctor right away if you have difficulty in moving, feeling of discomfort, fever, itching, joint pain or swelling, large, hive-like swelling on the face, eyelids, lips, tongue, throat, hands, legs, feet, or sex organs, muscle pain or stiffness, nausea, rash, swollen lymph glands, or vomiting.

This vaccine may increase the risk for nervous system problems, including Guillain-Barré syndrome. Check with your doctor right away if you have sudden numbness and weakness in the arms and legs or inability to move the arms and legs.

This vaccine contains albumin, which comes from human blood. Some human blood products have transmitted certain viruses (eg, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease) to people who have received them. The risk of getting a virus from medicines made of human blood has been greatly reduced in recent years. This is the result of required testing of human donors for certain viruses, and testing during the manufacture of these medicines. Although the risk is low, talk with your doctor if you have concerns.

This vaccine may not protect everyone who receives it. This vaccine will not treat symptoms of rabies virus if you already have the disease.

Fainting may occur after you receive this vaccine. Your doctor may want you to be observed after you get the injection to prevent and manage fainting.

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
