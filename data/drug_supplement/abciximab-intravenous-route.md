# Abciximab (intravenous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Reopro

## Description

Abciximab is used to lessen the chance of heart attack in people who need percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), a procedure to open blocked arteries of the heart.

A heart attack may occur when a blood vessel in the heart is blocked by a blood clot. Blood clots can sometimes form during PCI. Abciximab reduces the chance that a harmful clot will form by preventing certain cells in the blood from clumping together. Abciximab is used with aspirin and heparin, which are other medicines used to keep your blood from clotting.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
