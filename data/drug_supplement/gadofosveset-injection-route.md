## Description

Gadofosveset is a contrast agent. It is used in magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to help create a clear picture of the blood vessels (arteries). The MRA scan is a special kind of diagnostic procedure. It uses magnets and computers to create images or “pictures” of the blood vessels in certain areas of the body. Gadofosveset is a gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA).

Gadofosveset is given by injection before MRA to help diagnose problems in the blood vessels (e.g., blockage of the arteries).

This medicine is to be used only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor.
