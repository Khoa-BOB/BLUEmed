## Description

Epoetin injection is used to treat anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who may or may not be on dialysis. This medicine may also be used to prevent or treat anemia that is caused by surgery or medicines (eg, zidovudine) that are used for other conditions, such as HIV or cancer.

Epoetin injection is a man-made version of human erythropoietin (EPO). EPO is produced naturally in the body, mostly by the kidneys. It causes the bone marrow to produce red blood cells. If the body does not produce enough red blood cells, severe anemia can occur. This often occurs in people with chronic kidney failure whose kidneys are not working properly.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Solution

This medicine comes with a Medication Guide and patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.

If you are using this medicine at home:

- Use a new needle and syringe each time you inject your medicine.
- Do not use more medicine or use it more often than your doctor tells you to.
- You will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot.

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress regularly while you or your child are using this medicine. Blood tests are needed to check for unwanted effects. You may also need to monitor your blood pressure at home. If you notice any changes to your normal blood pressure, call your doctor right away. .

This medicine may increase your risk of having a heart attack, stroke, congestive heart failure, and blood clotting problems. Check with your doctor right away if you start having dizziness, fainting spells, severe tiredness, chest pain, trouble breathing, sudden or severe headache, or problems with vision, speech, or walking.

Do not use this medicine if you or your child have had an allergic reaction to albumin or products derived from human or animal cells.

This medicine contains benzyl alcohol which may cause serious reactions to newborn or premature infants. Discuss this with your doctor if you have concerns.

This medicine may increase the risk of convulsions (seizures) during the first few months of treatment. Talk with your doctor if you have concerns.

People with severe anemia usually feel very tired and sick. When epoetin begins to work, usually in about 6 weeks, most people start to feel better. Some people are able to be more active. However, epoetin only corrects anemia. It has no effect on kidney disease, cancer, or any other medical problem that needs regular medical attention. Even if you or your child are feeling much better, it is very important that you do not miss any appointments with your doctor or any dialysis treatments . .

This medicine may increase your risk of having blood clots. This is more likely in patients who use high doses of this medicine, or who use this medicine before a major surgery. Call your doctor right away if you have chest pain, trouble breathing, or pain, redness, or swelling in your legs while using this medicine. If you are getting dialysis treatments, tell your doctor right away if you notice blood clots at the injection site. Your doctor may give you a blood thinner before surgery to help prevent blood clots.

This medicine may cause blood clots to form in the access port (A-V shunt) for patients with chronic kidney disease who receive dialysis treatments. This would cause the access port to stop working. Tell your doctor right away if you or your child see blood clots forming in the access port.

When used in patients with certain types of cancer (eg, breast, cervix, lymphoid, lung, head, or neck cancer), this medicine has shortened survival time and worsened the tumor or cancer in some patients. If you or your child are concerned about this, talk with your doctor.

This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after using this medicine.

Serious skin reactions (eg, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis) can occur with this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you have blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, chills, cough, diarrhea, itching, joint or muscle pain, red irritated eyes, red skin lesions, often with a purple center, sore throat, sores, ulcers, or white spots in the mouth of on the lips, or unusual tiredness or weakness.

Epoetin is made from donated human blood. Some human blood products have transmitted certain viruses to people who have received them, although the risk is low. Human donors and donated blood are both tested for viruses to keep the transmission risk low. Talk with your doctor if you have concerns.

Many people with kidney problems need to be on a special diet. Also, people with high blood pressure (which may be caused by kidney disease or by epoetin treatment) may need to be on a special diet or to take medicine to keep their blood pressure under control. After their anemia has been corrected, some people feel so much better that they want to eat more than before. To keep your kidney disease or your high blood pressure from getting worse, it is very important that you or your child follow your special diet and take your medicines regularly, even if you are feeling better.
