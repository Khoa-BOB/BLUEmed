## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of dabigatran capsules or oral pellets in children with heart rhythm problems or who had hip replacement surgery. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of dabigatran capsules in children 8 years of age and older or dabigatran oral pellets in children younger than 12 years of age with blood clotting problems. Safety and efficacy have been established.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of dabigatran in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related stroke, bleeding, or kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving dabigatran.

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to take it. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

It is important to tell your doctor if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant before using this medicine. Using this medicine while you are pregnant may increase the risk of severe bleeding from your uterus.

Make sure any doctor who treats you knows that you are using this medicine. You may need to stop using this medicine for several days before having surgery, including dental procedures.

You may bleed and bruise more easily while you are using this medicine. Be extra careful to avoid injuries. Stay away from rough sports or other situations where you could be bruised, cut, or injured. Gently brush and floss your teeth. Be careful when using sharp objects, including razors and fingernail clippers. Avoid picking your nose. If you need to blow your nose, blow it gently.

Check with your doctor right away if you have any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, headache, dizziness, or weakness, pain, swelling, or discomfort in a joint, pinpoint red spots on your skin, unusual nosebleeds, or unusual vaginal bleeding that is heavier than normal. These may be signs of bleeding problems.

Do not suddenly stop using this medicine without asking first your doctor . Doing so may increase risk of blood clots and stroke.

This medicine may increase your risk of developing spinal or epidural blood clot. This usually occurs if you have an epidural catheter placed in your back to give you certain medicine, are taking NSAIDs or medicine to prevent blood clotting, or have a history of spinal problems or have had surgery on your spine. Check with your doctor if you have midline back pain, loss of bladder or bowel control, or numbness, tingling, or weakness of your legs or feet while you are using this medicine.

Check with your doctor right away if you have stomach pain or upset, nausea, heartburn, or indigestion while you are taking this medicine.
