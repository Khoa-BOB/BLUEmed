# Vinorelbine (intravenous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Navelbine

## Description

Vinorelbine injection is used to treat metastatic (cancer that has spread) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is also used together with other medicines (eg, cisplatin) for the first-line treatment of advanced or metastatic NSCLC.

Vinorelbine belongs to the group of medicines called antineoplastics. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal cells also may be affected by vinorelbine, other effects can occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Other effects, such as hair loss, may not be serious but may cause concern. Some effects may not occur until months or years after the medicine is used.

Vinorelbine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Solution
