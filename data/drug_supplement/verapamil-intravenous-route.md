# Verapamil (intravenous route)

## Description

Verapamil is used to control rapid heartbeats or abnormal heart rhythms. It belongs to a group of drugs called calcium channel blocking agents. Verapamil affects the movement of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. As a result, the heart beats slower and the blood vessels relax, thus, increasing the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart while reducing its workload .
