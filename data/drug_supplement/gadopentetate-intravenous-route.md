# Gadopentetate (intravenous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Magnevist

## Description

Gadopentetate injection is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent that is used to help create a clear picture of the body during an MRI scan. MRI scans are a special kind of diagnostic procedure that use magnets and computers to create images or “pictures” of certain areas inside the body. Unlike x-rays, they do not involve radiation. Gadopentetate is a gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA).

Gadopentetate is given by injection before MRI to help diagnose problems in the brain, spine, head, neck, tissues, and other parts of your body.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

This medicine contains a metal called gadolinium, which can stay in your body (including the brain, bones, skin) for a long time (several months to years). Talk to your doctor if you have concerns.
