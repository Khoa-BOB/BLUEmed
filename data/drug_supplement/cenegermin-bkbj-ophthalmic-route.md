This medicine comes with a patient information leaflet and patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.

To prepare the medicine:

- Push down the vial adapter blister pack onto the vial until it snaps into place over the vial's neck. Do not remove it from the vial after connecting it.
- Clean the surface of the valve on the connector part of the vial adapter with a sterile disinfectant wipe. Let it dry for about 1 minute.
- Screw a pipette (clockwise) into the connector part of the vial adapter. Make sure it is pushed all the way down.
- Turn the vial upside-down and gently pull the plunger until it stops to draw the eye drop solution into the pipette.
- Check the pipette to make sure it contains the eye drop solution. If it is empty, keep the vial with the connected pipette upside-down, push the plunger all the way in and pull it out again.
- Unscrew (counter-clockwise) and pull the pipette straight up after it has been correctly filled.

To use the eye drops:

- Wash your hands with soap and water before and after using this medicine.
- If you wear contact lenses, remove them before using this medicine. Wait at least 15 minutes before you put your contact lenses back in.
- Tilt your head back and, pressing your finger gently on the skin just beneath the lower eyelid, pull the lower eyelid away from the eye to make a space.
- Gently push the plunger down until at least a drop is released into the eye pocket. Do not touch your eye with the tip of the pipette. With your head still tilted back, blink a few times so that the medicine covers the surface of your eye.
- Throw the used pipette right away after use, even if there is still medicine left in it.
- To keep the medicine as germ-free as possible, do not touch the applicator tip to any surface (including the eye). Also, keep the container tightly closed. Serious damage to the eye and possible loss of vision may result from using contaminated eye medicines.
