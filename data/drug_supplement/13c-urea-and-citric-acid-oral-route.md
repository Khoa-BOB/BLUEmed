## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

IDkit Hp

## Description

13C urea and citric acid are medicines used in a diagnostic test called Exalenz BreathID® non-invasive breath test. It is a test that analyzes a breath sample before and after taking 13C-enriched urea to help diagnose patients with infections in the stomach caused by a bacteria called H. pylori.

Both of these medicines are taken by the mouth. If any H. pylori bacteria are present in the stomach, they will cause the 13C urea to be broken down into carbon dioxide gas. When you breathe out by the mouth, the amount of carbon dioxide can be measured by Exalenz BreathID® Hp System to detect whether the bacteria are in your stomach.

These medicines are available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
- Powder

## Proper Use

Exalenz BreathID® non-invasive breath test is a diagnostic test that analyzes a breath sample before and after taking 13C-enriched urea to help identify patients with H. pylori infection.

Your doctor will start the breath test by collecting your breath samples using the BreathID® Hp device. You will drink a mixed solution of 13C-urea tablet and citric acid powder. You must drink the solution within 2 hours after mixing it. Then, you have to breathe normally via the cannula while the test is being performed.

Do not eat for at least 1 hour before taking the mixed solution.

If the mixed solution has large particles after mixing it for 5 minutes, do not use it and open a new kit.

## Precautions

If you are taking antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors (eg, omeprazole, lansoprazole), or medicines containing bismuth, these may interact with the test. Your doctor will ask you to stop taking them for at least 2 weeks before the test.
