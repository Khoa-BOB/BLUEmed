## Precautions

Using this medicine during the last 3 months of pregnancy can harm your newborn baby. Check with your doctor right away if your baby has pale or blue lips, fingernails, or skin, difficult or trouble breathing, excessive sleepiness, or limpness. Tell your doctor right away if you are pregnant or if you think you have become pregnant while using this medicine.

If you think you need to take zolpidem for more than 7 to 10 days, be sure to discuss it with your doctor. Insomnia that lasts longer than this may be a sign of another medical problem.

Zolpidem may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hives, trouble breathing or swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, mouth, or throat while you are using this medicine.

This medicine may cause you to do things while you are still asleep that you may not remember the next morning. It is possible you could drive a car, sleepwalk, have sex, make phone calls, or prepare and eat food while you are asleep or not fully awake. Tell your doctor right away if you learn that any of these has happened .

This medicine will add to the effects of alcohol and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants. CNS depressants are medicines that slow down the nervous system, which may cause drowsiness or make you less alert. Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for hay fever, allergies, or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine, prescription pain medicine or narcotics, barbiturates or medicine for seizures, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics (numbing medicines), including some dental anesthetics. This effect may last for a few days after you stop taking this medicine. Check with your doctor before taking any of the above while you are using this medicine .

This medicine may cause some people, especially older persons, to become drowsy, dizzy, lightheaded, clumsy or unsteady, or less alert than they are normally, which may lead to falls. Even though zolpidem is taken at bedtime, it may cause some people to feel drowsy or less alert on arising. Also, this medicine may cause double vision or other vision problems, or severe injuries (eg, hip fractures, severe bleeding in the head). Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you .

If you develop any unusual and strange thoughts or behavior while you are using zolpidem, be sure to discuss it with your doctor. Some changes that have occurred in people using this medicine are like those seen in people who drink alcohol and then act in a manner that is not normal. Other changes may be more unusual and extreme, such as confusion, worsening of depression, hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or feeling things that are not there), suicidal thoughts, and unusual excitement, nervousness, or irritability.

Do not change your dose or stop using it without first checking with your doctor . Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping completely. This may help prevent a worsening of your condition and reduce the possibility of withdrawal symptoms, including confusion as to time, place, or person, hallucinations, holding false beliefs that cannot be changed by fact, seizures, stomach or muscle cramps, tremors, unusual excitement, nervousness, or restlessness, or vomiting.

If you think you or someone else may have taken an overdose of this medicine, get emergency help at once . Taking an overdose of zolpidem or taking alcohol or other CNS depressants with zolpidem may lead to serious breathing problems (eg, respiratory depression) and unconsciousness. Symptoms of an overdose include: severe drowsiness, severe nausea or vomiting, staggering, and trouble breathing.

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal (eg, St. John's wort) or vitamin supplements.
