# Haemophilus b conjugate and hepatitis b vaccine (intramuscular route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Comvax

## Description

Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine and hepatitis B vaccine is a combination immunizing agent that is used to prevent infection caused by the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) bacteria and hepatitis B virus. The vaccine works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease.

Infections with Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) bacteria can cause life-threatening illnesses, such as meningitis (a brain disease), epiglottitis (a throat disease that can cause suffocation), pericarditis (a heart disease), pneumonia (a lung disease), and septic arthritis (a bone and joint disease). Hib meningitis may cause death or leave the child with serious and permanent damage, such as intellectual disability, deafness, epilepsy, or partial blindness.

HBV infection is a major cause of serious liver diseases, such as hepatitis and cirrhosis, and a type of liver cancer called primary hepatocellular carcinoma.

Pregnant women who have hepatitis B infection or are carriers of hepatitis B virus can give the disease to their babies when they are born. These babies often suffer serious long-term illnesses from the disease.

Immunization against hepatitis B disease is recommended for all newborn babies, infants, and young children.

This vaccine is to be administered only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

When you are receiving this vaccine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.

### Other Medical Problems

The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this vaccine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:

- Allergy to yeast—Should not be used in patients with this condition.

- Bleeding problems (e.g., hemophilia, thrombocytopenia)—Use with caution. May have an increased risk of bleeding at the injection site.

- Severe illness with a fever—Your child's dose may need to be given at a later time.

- Weak immune system from a disease or medicine (e.g., those who are receiving a steroid, chemotherapy for cancer, or who have HIV infection)—May not work as well in patients with this condition.

## Proper Use

A nurse or other trained health professional will give your child this vaccine. This vaccine is given as a shot into one of your child's muscles, usually in the thighs.

This vaccine is usually given as 3 doses. It is usually given at 2, 4, and 12 to 15 months of age, unless your child's doctor tells you otherwise.

It is important that your child receive all of the doses of vaccine in this series. Try to keep all of your scheduled appointments. If your child does miss a dose of this vaccine, make another appointment as soon as possible.

## Precautions

It is very important that your child return to your doctor’s office at the right time for the second and third dose . Be sure to notify your child's doctor of any unwanted effects that occur after he or she receives the vaccine.

If your child develops a skin rash, hives, or any allergic reaction after receiving this vaccine, tell your child's doctor right away.

Tell your child's doctor right away if your child is allergic to latex rubber. The vaccine vials may contain dry natural latex rubber. This may cause an allergic reaction in patients who are sensitive to latex.

Before your child have any medical tests, tell the medical doctor in charge that your child is receiving this vaccine. The results of some tests may be affected by this vaccine.

This vaccine may not protect your child against diseases caused by haemophilus influenzae type b or hepatitis B infection if your child is already infected with the virus at the time he or she receives the shot.
