This medicine is used with a special inhaler that comes with a patient information leaflet and patient instructions. Read the directions carefully before using the medicine.

Also, ask your doctor to check regularly how you use the inhaler to make sure you are using it properly.

- Hold the inhaler with the mouthpiece facing you and the orange button is on top. Press the orange button all the way down and release it. Do not tilt the inhaler.
