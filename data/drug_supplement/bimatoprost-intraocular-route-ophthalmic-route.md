It is very important that your eye doctor (ophthalmologist) check your progress at regular visits to make sure this medicine is working properly and to check for unwanted effects.

If itching, redness, swelling, or other signs of eye or eyelid irritation occur, check with your doctor. These signs may mean that you are allergic to bimatoprost.

Your eyelashes may become longer and thicker. These changes to the lashes usually reverse after stopping the treatment. Also, these changes to the lashes will affect only the eye being treated with bimatoprost. Check with your doctor if you have any concerns about this.
