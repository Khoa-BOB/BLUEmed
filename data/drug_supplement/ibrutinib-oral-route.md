## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of ibrutinib to treat chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGHVD) in children younger than 1 year of age and to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic leukemia (SLL) with 17p deletion, and Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) in children. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of ibrutinib in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have unwanted effects (eg, anemia, pneumonia, bleeding problems, high blood pressure, heart rhythm problems), which may require caution in patients receiving ibrutinib.

This medicine may cause bleeding problems. Check with your doctor right away if you have bloody or black, tarry stools, red or dark brown urine, severe stomach pain, unusual bleeding, bruising, or weakness, or vomiting of blood or material that looks like coffee grounds.

Call your doctor right away if you have a cough that would not go away, back pain, dizziness or drowsiness, weight loss, night sweats, fever, chills, or flu-like symptoms, such as a runny or stuffy nose, headache, blurred vision, or feeling generally ill.

Ibrutinib can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:

- If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.
- Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.
- Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.
- Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.
- Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.
- Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.

Check with your doctor right away if you have chest pain or tightness, decreased urine output, dilated neck veins, irregular breathing, irregular heartbeat, swelling of the face, fingers, feet, or lower legs, trouble breathing, unusual tiredness or weakness, or weight gain. These may be symptoms of a serious heart problem (eg, heart rhythm problems, heart failure).

This medicine may cause a heart condition called atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation. Check with your doctor right away if you have a fast or irregular heartbeat, trouble breathing, lightheadedness, dizziness, or fainting.

Your doctor will check your blood pressure on a regular basis while you are using this medicine. You might need to monitor your blood pressure at home. Tell your doctor right away if you have a severe headache, lightheadedness, or changes in your vision.

Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, unusual tiredness or weakness, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.

This medicine may cause a serious type of reaction called tumor lysis syndrome. Your doctor may give you a medicine to help prevent this. Call your doctor right away if you have a change in how much or how often you urinate, joint pain, rapid weight gain, muscle or joint pain, swelling of the feet or lower legs, or unusual tiredness or weakness.
