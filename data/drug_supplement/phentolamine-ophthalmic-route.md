- Immediately after using the medicine, wash your hands to remove any medicine that may be on them.
- To keep the medicine as germ-free as possible, do not touch the applicator tip to any surface (including the eye). Also, keep the container tightly closed. Serious damage to the eye and possible loss of vision may result from using contaminated eye drops.

If you are wearing contact lenses, remove them before you use the eye drops. Wait for at least 10 minutes before putting the contact lenses back in.
