# Silodosin (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Rapaflo

## Description

Silodosin is used to treat signs and symptoms of an enlarged prostate gland, which is also known as benign enlargement of the prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH). Benign enlargement of the prostate is a problem that can occur in men as they get older. The prostate gland is located below the bladder. As the prostate gland gets larger, certain muscles in the gland may become tight and get in the way of the tube that drains urine from the bladder. This can cause problems in urinating, such as a need to urinate often, a weak stream when urinating, or a feeling of not being able to empty the bladder completely.

Silodosin helps relax the muscles in the prostate and in the opening to the bladder. This may help increase the flow of urine or decrease the symptoms.

This medicine is usually given only to men. It is not normally given to women or children.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Capsule

### Pediatric
