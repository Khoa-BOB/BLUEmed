## Description

Iobenguane I 123 is a radiopharmaceutical. Radiopharmaceuticals are radioactive agents, which may be used to find and treat certain diseases or to study the function of the body's organs.

Iobenguane I 123 is used to find certain kinds of cancer of the adrenal glands (eg, pheochromocytoma, neuroblastoma). When very small doses of iobenguane I 123 are given, the radioactivity taken up by the adrenal gland helps find tumors of the adrenal glands. An image of the gland on film or on a computer screen can be provided to help with the diagnosis.

Iobenguane I 123 is also used during a test for patients with congestive heart failure. This may help the doctor see certain heart problems.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor with specialized training in nuclear medicine.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
