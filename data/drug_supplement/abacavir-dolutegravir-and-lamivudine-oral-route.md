## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress at regular visits to make sure this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

You should not use this medicine together with dofetilide (Tikosyn®) . Using these medicines together may cause serious or life-threatening side effects.

Serious allergic reactions may occur while taking this medicine. These usually occur within 6 weeks after the medicine is started, but may occur at any time. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have a severe rash or rash with fever, blistering or peeling skin, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, joint or muscle pain, sores in the mouth, swelling of the face, trouble breathing, unusual tiredness or weakness, or yellow eyes or skin.

When you begin taking this medicine, you will be given a warning card which describes symptoms of severe allergic reactions that may be caused by Triumeq®. The warning card also provides information about how to treat these allergic reactions. For your safety, you should carry the warning card with you at all times.

If you must stop using this medicine because of an allergic reaction, you should never use the medicine again. Return the unused medicine to your doctor or pharmacist. A worse reaction, possibly even death, can occur if you use the medicine again. Tell your doctor right away if you have ever taken abacavir, especially if you have experienced an allergic reaction to it in the past.

Two rare but serious reactions to this medicine are lactic acidosis (too much acid in the blood) and liver toxicity, which includes an enlarged liver. These are more common if you are female, very overweight (obese), or have been taking anti-HIV medicines for a long time.

Your immune system may get stronger when you start taking HIV medicines. Tell your doctor right away if you or your child notices any changes in your health.

Autoimmune disorders (eg, Graves' disease, polymyositis, or Guillain-Barré syndrome) may also occur.

This medicine may cause you to have excess body fat. Tell your doctor right away if you notice changes in your body shape, including an increased amount of body fat in the neck or upper back, face, around the chest, or stomach area. You might also lose fat from your legs, arms, or face.

Call your doctor right away if you have chest pain or discomfort, pain or discomfort in the arms, jaw, back or neck, nausea, sweating, or vomiting.

It is important to practice safe sex, even if your partner also has HIV. Use a latex condom or other barrier method. Do not reuse or share needles, or other items, that may have blood or body fluids on them.
