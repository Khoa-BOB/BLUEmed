## Description

Trastuzumab injection is used to treat HER2-overexpressing new or metastatic (cancer that has spread) breast cancer. It can be used alone or with other cancer medicines (eg, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, docetaxel, doxorubicin, paclitaxel).

Trastuzumab injection is also used in combination with cisplatin and capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil to treat HER2-overexpressing metastatic (cancer that has spread) stomach and gastroesophageal (stomach and esophagus) cancer.

Trastuzumab prevents the growth of some tumors that produce extra amounts of a certain substance known as the HER2 protein. It should only be used in patients whose tumors have been shown to produce extra amounts of this protein (HER2 overexpression) .

Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by trastuzumab, other effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Other effects, such as a skin rash, may not be serious but may cause concern. Some effects do not occur until months or years after the medicine is used.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Powder for Solution
