# Rosuvastatin (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Crestor

Ezallor

## Description

Rosuvastatin is used together with a proper diet to lower bad cholesterol (LDL) and triglycerides (fats) in the blood, and to increase your good cholesterol (HDL). It is also used to treat adults who cannot control their cholesterol levels by diet and exercise alone. Rosuvastatin may help prevent or slow down medical problems, like atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), that are caused by fats clogging the blood vessels. It may also be used to reduce the risk of death, heart attack, stroke, or other blood vessel problems in patients with risk factors for heart problems.

Rosuvastatin belongs to a group of medicines called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, or statins. It works by blocking an enzyme that is needed by the body to make cholesterol, so this reduces the amount of cholesterol in the blood.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
- Capsule
