This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of bupivacaine liposome injection for local analgesia in children younger than 6 years of age and for regional analgesia in children. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of bupivacaine liposome injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have kidney problems, which may require caution for patients receiving bupivacaine liposome injection.

## Proper Use

A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine in a hospital. It is given through a needle injected into the tissue at the surgical site (eg, foot) or into the nerve endings of the brachial plexus (nerves that conduct signals to the shoulder, arm, and hand).

This medicine should cause numbness only to the area where it is injected. You may experience temporary loss of sensation or movement to the injected area for up to 5 days. This type of numbing procedure is called local anesthesia. It is not meant to cause you to fall asleep or become unconscious.

Bupivacaine liposome injection (Exparel®) works differently than other forms of bupivacaine, even at the same dose. You should not receive another type of bupivacaine injection or another anesthetic within 4 days (96 hours) after the injection of Exparel®.

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your progress closely after you receive this medicine to see if the medicine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for any unwanted effects.

This medicine should not be given to women during labor (obstetrical paracervical block anesthesia).

This medicine may cause a rare, but serious blood problem called methemoglobinemia. The risk may be increased in elderly patients or patients with certain inborn defects. It is more likely to occur in patients receiving too much of the medicine, but can also occur with small amounts. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child has the following symptoms after receiving this medicine: pale, gray, or blue-colored skin, lips, or nails, confusion, headache, lightheadedness, fast heartbeat, or unusual tiredness or weakness.

Tell your doctor or nurse right away if you have the following symptoms with this medicine: anxiety, blurred vision, depression, drowsiness, lightheadedness, nausea or vomiting, numbness and tingling of the mouth or lips, restlessness, ringing in the ears, speech problems, or tremors.

This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, mouth, or throat after receiving this medicine.

This medicine may make you dizzy or drowsy. Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you.

This medicine may also increase your risk of having serious heart and blood vessel problems (eg, heart attack, heart rhythm changes, or low blood pressure). Check with your doctor if you have chest pain or discomfort, pain or discomfort in the arms, jaw, back, or neck, dizziness, fainting, pounding, slow heartbeat, trouble breathing, or unusual tiredness or weakness.

Check with your doctor if you have joint pain, stiffness, or loss of motion of the shoulder. This may be symptoms of a serious bone or joint problem called chondrolysis.

Check with your doctor before receiving this medicine with other medicines that affect the central nervous system (CNS). The use of other medicines that affect the CNS with bupivacaine liposome injection may worsen the side effects of this medicine, including dizziness, poor concentration, drowsiness, unusual dreams, and trouble with sleeping. Some examples of medicines that affect the CNS are antihistamines or medicine for allergies or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicines, medicine for depression, medicine for anxiety, prescription pain medicine or narcotics, medicine for attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, or muscle relaxants.
