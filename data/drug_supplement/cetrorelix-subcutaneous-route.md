# Cetrorelix (subcutaneous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Cetrotide

## Description

Cetrorelixis a man-made hormone that blocks the effects of Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH).

Cetrorelix does not allow the premature release of these eggs to occur.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
