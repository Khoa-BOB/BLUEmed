# Raltegravir (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Isentress

Isentress HD

## Description

Raltegravir is used together with other medicines for the treatment of the infection caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This medicine is usually given to patients who have already received HIV medicines in the past.

Raltegravir will not cure or prevent HIV infection or AIDS. It helps keep HIV from reproducing and appears to slow down the destruction of the immune system. This may help delay problems that are usually related to AIDS or HIV disease from occurring. Raltegravir will not keep you from spreading HIV to other people. People who receive this medicine may continue to have other problems usually related to AIDS or HIV disease.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
- Powder for Suspension
- Tablet, Chewable
