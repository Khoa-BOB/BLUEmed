# Nirsevimab-alip (intramuscular route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Beyfortus

## Description

Nirsevimab-alip injection is used to prevent serious lung infection caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This medicine is given to newborns and babies under 1 year of age during or entering their first RSV season. It is also given to children up to 24 months of age who are still at risk of RSV disease through their second RSV season. This medicine works by giving your body antibodies to protect it against RSV infection.

RSV infection can cause serious problems that affect the lungs, such as pneumonia and bronchitis, and in severe cases can even cause death. These problems are more likely to occur in infants and children younger than 6 months of age with chronic lung disease and breathing problems. Babies who were born premature or babies who were born with heart disease may also have problems with RSV.

The onset of RSV activity usually occurs in November and continues through April, but it may begin earlier or continue later in certain communities. A good way to help prevent RSV infection is to receive palivizumab before the start of the RSV season.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Solution
