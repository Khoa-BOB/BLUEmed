## Brand Name

## Description

Gonadorelin is a medicine that is the same as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) that is naturally released from the hypothalamus gland. GnRH causes the pituitary gland to release other hormones (luteinizing hormone [LH] and follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH]). LH and FSH control development in children and fertility in adults.

Gonadorelin is used to test how well the hypothalamus and the pituitary glands are working. It is also used to cause ovulation (release of an egg from the ovary) in women who do not have regular ovulation and menstrual periods because the hypothalamus gland does not release enough GnRH.

Gonadorelin may also be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.

### Other Medical Problems

The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:

- Gonadotropin-releasing hormone adenoma—Although this condition is rare, use of gonadorelin when this condition exists may cause problems in the pituitary gland and could result in sudden blindness
- Any condition that may be made worse by estrogens, progestins, or androgens, such as a hormone-dependent tumor—The increase of estrogens and progestins in women or androgens in men that can result from use of multiple doses of gonadorelin may make a tumor worse if the tumor depends on estrogens, progestins, or androgens for growth

## Proper Use

If you are having a test done with gonadorelin, one or more samples of your blood will be taken. Then gonadorelin is given by an intravenous (into a vein) or a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. At regular times after the medicine is given, more blood samples will be taken. Then the results of the test will be studied.

Some medicines given by injection or by injection pump may sometimes be given at home to patients who do not need to be in the hospital. If you are using this medicine at home, make sure you clearly understand and carefully follow your doctor's instructions.
