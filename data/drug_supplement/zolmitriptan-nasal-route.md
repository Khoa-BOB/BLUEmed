## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Zomig

## Description

Zolmitriptan nasal spray is used to treat acute migraine headaches in adults and children 12 years of age and older. It is not used to prevent migraine headaches and is not used for cluster headaches. Zolmitriptan works in the brain to relieve the pain from migraine headaches. It belongs to the group of medicines called triptans.

Many people find that their headaches go away completely after they use zolmitriptan. Other people find that their headaches are much less painful, and that they are able to go back to their normal activities even though their headaches are not completely gone. Zolmitriptan often relieves other symptoms that occur together with a migraine headache, such as nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, and sensitivity to sound.

Zolmitriptan is not an ordinary pain reliever. It will not relieve any kind of pain other than migraine headaches. This medicine is usually used for people whose headaches are not relieved by acetaminophen, aspirin, or other pain relievers.

Zolmitriptan has caused serious side effects in some people, especially people who have heart or blood vessel disease. Be sure that you discuss with your doctor the risks of using this medicine as well as the benefits that it can have.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Spray

## Proper Use

Use this medicine only as directed by your doctor . Do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. Using too much zolmitriptan may increase the chance of side effects.

This medicine is for use only in the nose . Do not get any of it in your eyes or on your skin. If it does get on these areas, rinse it off right away.

Do not use zolmitriptan for a headache that is different from your usual migraines. Instead, check with your doctor.

To relieve your migraine as soon as possible, use zolmitriptan as soon as the headache pain begins. Even if you get warning signals of a coming migraine (an aura), you should wait until the headache pain starts before using zolmitriptan.

Ask your doctor ahead of time about any other medicine you might take if zolmitriptan does not work. After you take the other medicine, check with your doctor as soon as possible. Headaches that are not relieved by zolmitriptan are sometimes caused by conditions that need other treatment.

If you feel much better after a dose of zolmitriptan, but your headache comes back or gets worse after a while, you may use one additional dose of zolmitriptan 2 hours after the first dose. Do not use more than 3 doses in any 24-hour period.

Check with your doctor if you have used zolmitriptan and your migraine got worse or started occurring more often.

This medicine may increase your risk of having abnormal heart rhythm, heart attack, angina, or stroke.
