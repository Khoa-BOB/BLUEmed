### US Brand Name

## Description

Abemaciclib is used together with tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor (eg, anastrozole, exemestane, letrozole) to treat hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER-2 negative, node-positive, early breast cancer with a high risk of coming back as determined by your doctor.

Abemaciclib is also used together with an aromatase inhibitor (eg, anastrozole, exemestane, letrozole) as initial hormonal treatment to treat men and postmenopausal women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER-2 negative advanced (cancer that has worsened) or metastatic (cancer that has spread) breast cancer. It is also used alone or together with fulvestrant to treat HR-positive, HER-2 negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer in women who have received hormonal treatment or other cancer medicines that did not work well.

Abemaciclib belongs to the group of medicines called antineoplastics. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal cells may also be affected by the medicine, other unwanted effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
