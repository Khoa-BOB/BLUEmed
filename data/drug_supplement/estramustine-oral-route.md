While you are being treated with estramustine, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccinations) without your doctor's approval. Estramustine may lower your body's resistance and there is a chance you might get the infection the immunization is meant to prevent. In addition, other persons living in your household should not take oral polio vaccine since there is a chance they could pass the polio virus on to you.

If you cannot take these precautions, you should consider wearing a protective face mask that covers the nose and mouth.
