## Description

Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine (also known as DTP vaccine) combined with hepatitis B and poliovirus vaccine (also known as HepB and IPV) is a combination immunizing agent used to prevent illness caused by diphtheria, tetanus (lockjaw), pertussis (whooping cough), hepatitis B, and poliovirus. The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against these diseases. This vaccine is given only to infants and children who are 6 weeks to 6 years of age, and is given before the child’s 7th birthday.

This vaccine combines five agents into one vaccine. In order to complete the series, you must get three injections of this vaccine at separate intervals. Because there are many different diseases you will need to be vaccinated against, make sure to follow your doctor's directions about your vaccination schedule.

Diphtheria is a serious illness that can cause breathing difficulties, heart problems, nerve damage, pneumonia, and possibly death. The risk of serious complications is greater in very young children and the elderly.

Tetanus (also known as lockjaw) is a very serious illness that causes convulsions (seizures) and severe muscle spasms that can be strong enough to cause bone fractures of the spine. Tetanus causes death in 30% to 40% of cases. The disease continues to occur almost exclusively among people who do not get vaccinated or do not have enough protection from previous vaccines.

Pertussis (also known as whooping cough) is a serious disease that causes severe spells of coughing that can interfere with breathing. Pertussis can also cause pneumonia, long-lasting bronchitis, seizures, brain damage, and death.

Hepatitis B infection is a major cause of serious liver diseases, including liver cancer. You get hepatitis B by being exposed to someone else's body fluids. Pregnant women who have hepatitis B infection or are carriers of hepatitis B virus can give the disease to their babies when they are born. These babies often suffer serious long-term illnesses from the disease. People who have the virus can give it to others without them knowing it.

Polio is a very serious infection that causes paralysis of the muscles, including the muscles that enable you to walk and breathe. A polio infection may leave a person unable to breathe without the help of a breathing machine. It may also leave a person unable to walk without leg braces or being confined to a wheelchair. There is no cure for polio.

This vaccine is to be administered only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Suspension

This vaccine is usually given as three shots. The first dose may be given as early as 6 weeks of age. You will need another dose at 4 and 6 months after the first dose, unless your doctor tells you otherwise.

Your child may receive other vaccines at the same time as this one, but in a different body area. You should receive information sheets about all of the vaccines your child receives. Make sure you understand all of the information that is given to you.

Your child may also receive a medicine to help prevent or treat some of the minor side effects of the vaccine, such as fever and soreness.

It is important that your child receive all of the doses of vaccine in this series. Try to keep all of your scheduled appointments. If your child does miss a dose of this vaccine, make another appointment as soon as possible.

## Precautions

It is very important that your child return to your doctor's office for the second and third dose of this vaccine . Be sure to notify your doctor or clinic of any side effects that may occur after your child has received the vaccine.

If your child develops a skin rash, hives, or any allergic reaction after receiving this vaccine, tell your child's doctor right away.
