## Description

Rizatriptan is used to treat acute migraine headaches with or without aura. It is not used to prevent migraine headaches and is not used for cluster headaches. Rizatriptan works in the brain to relieve the pain from migraine headaches. It belongs to the group of medicines called triptans.

Many people find that their headaches go away completely after they take rizatriptan. Other people find that their headaches are much less painful, and that they are able to go back to their normal activities even though their headaches are not completely gone. Rizatriptan often relieves other symptoms that occur together with a migraine headache, such as nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, and sensitivity to sound.

Rizatriptan is not an ordinary pain reliever. It will not relieve any kind of pain other than migraine headaches. This medicine is usually used for people whose headaches are not relieved by acetaminophen, aspirin, or other pain relievers.

Rizatriptan has caused serious side effects in some people, especially people who have heart or blood vessel disease. Be sure that you discuss with your doctor the risks of using this medicine as well as the benefits that it can do.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
- Tablet, Disintegrating

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of rizatriptan in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have diabetes, high blood pressure, and age-related heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving rizatriptan.

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check the progress of you or your child at regular visits . This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you or your child should continue to take it.

Do not use this medicine if you or your child have used other triptan or ergot-type migraine medicines within the past 24 hours. Some examples of triptan medicines are almotriptan (Axert™), eletriptan (Relpax®), frovatriptan (Frova®), naratriptan (Amerge®), sumatriptan (Imitrex®, Treximet®), and zolmitriptan (Zomig®). Some examples of ergot-type medicines are dihydroergotamine (D.H.E. 45®, Migranal®), ergotamine (Bellergal®, Cafergot®, Ergomar®, or Wigraine®), and  methysergide (Sansert®). Do not take this medicine within 2 weeks after taking an MAO inhibitor, such as Eldepryl®, Marplan®, Nardil®, or Parnate®. Do not use this medicine if you are using propranolol (Inderal®, Inderal® LA, InnoPran XL®).

Check with your doctor if you or your child used this medicine and your migraine did not go away, or if your migraine got worse or started occurring more often.

This medicine may increase your risk of having abnormal heart rhythm, heart attack, angina, or stroke. This is more likely to occur if you or a family member already has heart disease, if you have diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, if you smoke, if you are male and over 40 years of age, or if you are female and have gone through menopause. Call your doctor right away if you have chest pain or discomfort, confusion, difficulty with speaking, double vision, headaches, inability to move the arms, legs, or facial muscles, uneven heartbeat, nausea or vomiting, pain or discomfort in the shoulders, arms, jaw, back, or neck, trouble breathing, slow speech, or sweating.

Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have chest discomfort, jaw or neck tightness after taking this medicine. Also, tell your doctor if you have sudden or severe stomach pain or bloody diarrhea after using this medicine.

Check with your doctor right away if you have blurred vision, difficulty with reading, or any other change in vision while you or your child are using this medicine. Your doctor may want you to have your eyes checked by an ophthalmologist (eye doctor).

This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention.

Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have agitation, confusion, diarrhea, excitement while talking that is not normal, fever, overactive reflexes, poor coordination, restlessness, shivering, sweating, trembling or shaking that you cannot control, or twitching. These could be symptoms of serotonin syndrome.

Drinking alcoholic beverages can make headaches worse or cause new headaches to occur. People who suffer from severe headaches should probably avoid alcoholic beverages, especially during a headache.

Some people feel dizzy or drowsy during or after a migraine, or after taking rizatriptan to relieve a migraine. As long as you are feeling dizzy or drowsy, do not drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy or not alert .
