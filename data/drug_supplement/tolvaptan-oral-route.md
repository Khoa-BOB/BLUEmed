# Tolvaptan (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Jynarque

Samsca

## Description

Tolvaptan is used to treat hyponatremia (low sodium in the blood) in patients with heart failure or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).

Tolvaptan is also used to slow kidney function decline in adults who are at risk of rapidly progressing autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).

Sodium is a chemical that the body needs for it to function well. If you have a low sodium blood level, your body will not function normally and you may not feel well. Tolvaptan works in the kidneys to help maintain the right amount of sodium for the body.

Samsca® is available only with your doctor's prescription. Jynarque™ is available only under a restricted distribution program called the Jynarque™ REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) Program.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of tolvaptan in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of tolvaptan in the elderly.
