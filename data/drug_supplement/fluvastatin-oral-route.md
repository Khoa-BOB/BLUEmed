## Description

Fluvastatin is used together with a proper diet to lower high cholesterol levels and triglycerides (fats) in the blood. This medicine may help prevent medical problems, like atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), that are caused by fats clogging the blood vessels.

Fluvastatin belongs to the group of medicines called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, or statins. It works to reduce the amount of cholesterol in the blood by blocking an enzyme that is needed to make cholesterol.
