## Precautions

It is important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to allow changes in your dose and help reduce any side effects. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

Do not take vortioxetine if you have taken a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor (eg, Eldepryl®, Marplan®, Nardil®, Parnate®), methylene blue injection, or linezolid in the past 14 days. Do not start taking a MAO inhibitor within 21 days of stopping vortioxetine. If you do, you may develop confusion, agitation, restlessness, sudden high body temperature, extremely high blood pressure, or severe convulsions.

Vortioxetine may cause some teenagers and young adults to be agitated, irritable, or display other abnormal behaviors. It may also cause some people to have suicidal thoughts and tendencies or to become more depressed. Some people may have trouble sleeping, get upset easily, have a big increase in energy, or start to act reckless. If you or your caregiver notice any of these unwanted effects, tell your doctor right away. Let the doctor know if you or anyone in your family has bipolar disorder (manic-depressive) or has tried to commit suicide.

Vortioxetine may cause a serious condition called serotonin syndrome if taken together with some medicines, including buspirone (Buspar®), fentanyl (Abstral®, Duragesic®), lithium (Eskalith®, Lithobid®), tryptophan, St. John's wort, other medicines for depression (eg, SNRIs, SSRIs, TCAs), or some pain or migraine medicines (eg, meperidine, methadone, rizatriptan, sumatriptan, tramadol, Demerol®, Methadose®, Frova®, Imitrex®, Maxalt®, Relpax®, Ultram®, Zomig®).

Hyponatremia (low sodium in the blood) may occur with this medicine. This is more common in elderly patients, those who are taking diuretic medicines for high blood pressure, or those who have decreased amounts of fluid in the body due to severe diarrhea or vomiting. Check with your doctor right away if you have confusion, difficulty concentrating, headaches, memory problems, weakness, and unsteadiness.

Do not suddenly stop taking this medicine without checking first with your doctor . Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely. This will decrease the chance of having withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, dizziness, headache, irritability, muscle tension, mood swings, nausea, runny nose, sudden outbursts of anger, or sweating.

This medicine may cause some people to become dizzy. Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you .
