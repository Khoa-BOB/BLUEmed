## Proper Use

This medicine comes with a Medication Guide and a patient information insert. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.

Take the medicine on an empty stomach. It should be taken as soon as you get out of bed in the morning and at least 30 minutes before any food, beverage, or other medicines . Food and beverages (eg, mineral water, coffee, tea, or juice) will decrease the amount of alendronate absorbed by the body. Waiting longer than 30 minutes will allow more of the drug to be absorbed. Medicines such as antacids, calcium, or vitamin supplements will also decrease the absorption of alendronate.

If you are using alendronate oral liquid , drink at least 2 ounces (a quarter of a cup) of water immediately after taking the medicine. This will allow the medicine to reach your intestines and be absorbed by the body more quickly.

Swallow the tablet whole with a full glass (6 to 8 ounces) of plain water. Do not suck or chew on the tablet because it may cause throat irritation.

The effervescent tablet should not be chewed, swallowed whole, or dissolved in the mouth to prevent the risk of mouth or throat irritation.

If you are taking alendronate effervescent tablet , dissolve it in 4 ounces of room temperature plain water only (not mineral water or flavored water). Wait at least 5 minutes after the effervescence stops and then stir the solution for 10 seconds and drink it.

Do not lie down for at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate and before having your first food for the day . This will help alendronate reach your stomach faster. It will also help prevent irritation to your esophagus.

It is important that you eat a well-balanced diet with adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D (found in milk or other dairy products). However, do not take any foods, beverages, or calcium supplements within 30 minutes or longer after taking the alendronate. To do so may keep this medicine from working properly.

Follow your dosing instructions given to you by your doctor closely. It may affect the way this medicine works if you do not. Do not stop using this medicine suddenly without asking your doctor.

Tell your doctor if you do weight-bearing exercises, smoke or drink excessively. Your doctor will need to take these into consideration in deciding your dose.
