For Ameluz® topical gel :

For Levulan® Kerastick® topical solution :

After aminolevulinic acid application, avoid exposure to sunlight or bright indoor light (eg, from examination lamps, operating room lamps, tanning beds, or being close to lights) up until the time of the blue or red light treatment. Wear long-sleeved shirts, gloves, or other protective clothing to shade the treated skin before blue light treatment . Wide-brimmed hats or similar head covering can help protect you from sunlight or sources of light. Sunscreens will not protect you from sunlight or sources of light.
