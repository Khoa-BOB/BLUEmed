## Brand Name

NexIUM

## Description

Esomeprazole is used to treat conditions where there is too much acid in the stomach. It is used to treat duodenal and gastric ulcers, erosive esophagitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, a condition wherein the stomach produces too much acid. Esomeprazole is also used with antibiotics (eg, amoxicillin, clarithromycin) to treat ulcers that are caused by the H. pylori bacteria. This medicine is also used to prevent stomach ulcers and stomach irritation in patients taking NSAIDs (eg, aspirin, ibuprofen) for long periods of time.

Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). It works by decreasing the amount of acid that is produced by the stomach.

This medicine is available both over-the-counter (OTC) and with your doctor’s prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Capsule, Delayed Release
- Packet
- Tablet, Delayed Release
