## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

## Description

Canakinumab injection is used to treat cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), including familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS). CAPS is a rare, inherited disease of the immune system.

Canakinumab injection is also used to treat tumor necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS)/mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), and familial Mediterranean fever (FMF).

Canakinumab injection is also used to treat active Still's disease, including adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA).

Canakinumab injection is also used to treat gout flares in patients who are not able to receive or tolerate treatment, or have not responded to treatment with colchicine and NSAIDs. It is also used to treat gout flares in patients who are not able to receive repeated treatment with steroid medicines.

CAPS, TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, and FMF are autoinflammatory periodic fever syndromes and Still's disease is an autoinflammatory disease. Autoinflammatory conditions occur when the body produces too much of a chemical called interleukin-1 beta. This chemical causes inflammation (swelling) and patients may have a fever, headache, skin rash, joint or muscle pain, or unusual tiredness or weakness. Canakinumab is an interleukin-1 beta blocker. It helps prevent inflammation by keeping the interleukin-1 beta from working properly.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Solution
