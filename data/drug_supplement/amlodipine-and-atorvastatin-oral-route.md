# Amlodipine and atorvastatin (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Caduet

## Description

Amlodipine is used alone or together with other medicines to treat high blood pressure. High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled.

Amlodipine is also used to relieve chronic stable angina (chest pain) or vasospastic angina (Prinzmetal's or variant angina). This medicine is also used to lower the risk of hospitalization for angina and heart surgery (eg, coronary revascularization) in patients with recently documented coronary artery disease (CAD) by angiography and without certain heart problems (eg, heart failure or an ejection fraction less than 40%).

Atorvastatin is used together with a proper diet to lower cholesterol and triglyceride (fats) levels in the blood. This medicine may help prevent medical problems (eg, chest pain, heart attack, or stroke) that are caused by fats clogging the blood vessels. It may also be used to prevent certain types of heart and blood vessel problems in patients with risk factors for heart problems.

Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker. It works by affecting the movement of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. This relaxes the blood vessels and lowers blood pressure, and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart while reducing its workload.

Atorvastatin belongs to the group of medicines called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, or statins. It works by blocking an enzyme that is needed by the body to make cholesterol, and this reduces the amount of cholesterol in the blood.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
