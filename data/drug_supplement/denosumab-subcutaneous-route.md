## Description

Denosumab injection is used to treat osteoporosis (thinning of the bones) in women who have an increased risk for fractures after menopause, and osteoporosis in men. It is given when other medicines cannot be used or after other medicines did not work well. It is also used to treat osteoporosis in patients using steroid medicines for at least 6 months.

Denosumab injection is also used to treat bone loss in men with prostate cancer and women with breast cancer who are at high risk for fracture receiving treatment for their cancer that has not spread throughout the body.

Denosumab injection is also used to prevent bone problems in patients with multiple myeloma and bone metastases (cancer that has spread) from tumors. This medicine is also used to treat giant cell tumor of the bone that cannot be removed by surgery or when surgery is too risky. This medicine is also used to treat hypercalcemia (high calcium in the blood) associated with cancer that did not respond to bisphosphonate treatment.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
