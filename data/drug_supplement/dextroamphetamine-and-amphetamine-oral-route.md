This medicine is available only with a doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine combination to treat ADHD in children. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 3 years of age for Adderall® tablets and in children younger than 13 years of age for Mydayis® extended-release capsules .

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of Adderall XR® extended-release capsules in children younger than 6 years of age.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of Adderall® tablets and Adderall XR® extended-release capsules have not been performed in the geriatric population.
