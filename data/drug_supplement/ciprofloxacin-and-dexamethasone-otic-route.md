## Proper Use

Use this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor . Do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may increase the chance of side effects.

This medicine should come with patient information leaflet. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.

This medicine should be used only in the ear . Do not put it in the eyes or nose, and do not take it by mouth or inject it. If this medicine is swallowed by accident or gets in your eyes, call your doctor right away. .

It is important that the infected ear remain clean and dry. When bathing, avoid getting the infected ear wet. Avoid swimming unless your doctor has instructed you otherwise.

To use the ear drops:

- Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water
- Hold the bottle in your hands for 1 or 2 minutes to warm the medicine. Cold drops could cause you to become dizzy.
- Shake the bottle well before using it.
- Lie down on your side with your infected ear facing up.
- Drop the prescribed number of drops into the ear. Keep the ear tilted up for 60 seconds.
- To keep the medicine as germ-free as possible, do not touch the applicator tip to any surface (including the ear). Also, keep the container tightly closed.
- For patients with middle ear infection with tubes: While the person getting the ear drops lies on their side, the person giving the drops should gently press the small projection in front of the outside opening of the ear 5 times in a pumping motion. This will allow the drops to pass through the tube and into the middle ear.
- For patients with outer ear infection (“swimmer's ear”): While the person getting the ear drops lies on their side, the person giving the drops should gently pull the outer ear lobe upward and backward. This will allow the ear drops to flow down into the ear canal.
- The person who just had the ear drops should stay on their side for at least one minute. Repeat the above steps if both ears are infected.
- When you have completed your course of therapy (usually 7 days), throw away any unused medicine.
