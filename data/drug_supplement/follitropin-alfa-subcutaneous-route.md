## Description

Follitropin alfa is a hormone identical to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) produced by the pituitary gland. FSH helps to develop eggs in the ovaries.

Follitropin alfa injection is used as a fertility medicine to develop eggs in women who have not been able to become pregnant because of problems in ovulation. Also, many women wanting to become pregnant will use this medicine while enrolled in a fertility program called assisted reproductive technology (ART). ART uses procedures such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) or embryo transfer (ET). Follitropin alfa may be used with other medicines for these purposes.

Follitropin alfa injection is also used as a fertility medicine to help men with low sperm counts produce more sperms. Treatment with human chorionic gonadotropin should come before treatment with follitropin alfa. This pretreatment elevates the amount of testosterone to the correct level. Treatment with human chorionic gonadotropin should continue as long as follitropin alfa is being used.

Some patients may be treated with another hormone called gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) before starting treatment with follitropin alfa. GnRHa reduces the amount of FSH released from the pituitary gland. This is done so that the doctor can replace their FSH with follitropin alfa in the proper amounts each day to achieve fertility.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Solution
- Powder for Solution

If you are a woman who can get pregnant, your doctor may do tests to make sure you are not pregnant before starting treatment. Call your doctor right away if you think you have become pregnant while you are using this medicine . You may have a higher risk of an ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage if you get pregnant while undergoing IVF procedures. An ectopic pregnancy can be a serious and life-threatening condition. It can also cause problems that may make it harder for you to become pregnant in the future.

If your doctor has asked you to record your basal body temperature (BBT) daily, make sure that you know how to do this. Carefully follow your doctor's instructions.

This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are using this medicine.

This medicine may increase your risk of having problems with the ovaries including twisting or enlargement of the ovaries, or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). OHSS is a serious problem that can be life-threatening. Call your doctor right away if you have severe pain in the lower stomach area, nausea, vomiting, weight gain, diarrhea, decreased urine output, or trouble breathing.

This medicine may cause serious lung problems (eg, atelectasis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or asthma). Check with your doctor right away if you have blue lips, fingernails, or skin, chest tightness, coughing, difficulty or fast breathing, fever, rapid heartbeat, or trouble breathing.

Contact your doctor right away if you have chest pain or tightness, a fast or irregular heartbeat, unusual flushing or warmth of the skin, increased coughing, trouble breathing, a sudden difficulty with breathing at night, or abnormal swelling in your ankles or legs. These could be symptoms of serious heart problems or blood clots.

This medicine may cause more than one egg to be released from your ovary at the same time. This means you may become pregnant with more than one baby. Talk with your doctor about this possibility before you start using this medicine.

This medicine may increase your risk of having ovarian cancer if you received it more than one time to get pregnant. Talk to your doctor about this risk.
