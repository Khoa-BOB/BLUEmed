## Description

Budesonide is used to treat mild to moderate active Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease. This medicine works inside the intestines (bowels) to reduce inflammation and symptoms of the disease. It also helps keep the symptoms of Crohn's disease from coming back. Budesonide is a steroid (cortisone-like) medicine.

Budesonide extended-release tablets are used to help get active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis under control (induce remission).

Budesonide delayed-release capsules are used to reduce levels of protein in the urine (proteinuria) in patients who have a kidney disease called primary immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), who are at risk of progressing.

Budesonide oral liquid is used to treat eosinophilic esophagitis (inflammation of the esophagus).

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Suspension
- Capsule, Extended Release

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of budesonide delayed-release capsules in children 8 to 17 years of age and weighing more than 25 kilograms (kg). However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 8 years of age, or in children 8 to 17 years of age and weighs 25 kg or less. Safety and efficacy have not been established to help keep the symptoms of Crohn's disease from coming back in children. Because budesonide may cause slowed growth in children, those who will be using it for a long time should have their weight and growth measured by the doctor regularly.
