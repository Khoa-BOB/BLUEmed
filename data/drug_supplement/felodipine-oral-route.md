# Felodipine (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Plendil

## Description

Felodipine is used alone or together with other medicines to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled.

Felodipine is a calcium channel blocker. It works by affecting the movement of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. Felodipine relaxes blood vessels and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart, which reduces the workload.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet, Extended Release

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of felodipine in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatrics-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of felodipine in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems which may require an adjustment of dose in patients receiving felodipine.
