# Metyrapone (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Metopirone

## Description

Metyrapone is used in the diagnosis of certain problems of the adrenal glands. These glands are located near the kidneys. The adrenal glands produce a steroid chemical called cortisol (hydrocortisone) that helps the body respond to stress or illness. From the results of a metyrapone test, your doctor will be able to tell if your adrenal glands produce the correct amount of cortisol under stress or during illnesses.

How test is done: Metyrapone is taken by mouth in one or more doses the day before the testing is done. The next day, blood and/or urine samples are taken. A tube called a catheter may be placed in your bladder to help take the urine sample. The amount of hormones in your blood or urine is measured. Then the results of the test are studied.

Metyrapone may also be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.

Metyrapone is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Capsule
