# Chlophedianol (oral route)

## Description

Chlophedianol is used to relieve dry, irritating coughs. This medicine should not be used when there is mucus or phlegm (pronounced flem) with the cough.

Chlophedianol relieves cough by acting on the cough center in the brain.

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

This medicine has been tested in children 2 years of age or older. In effective doses, the medicine has not been shown to cause different side effects or problems in children than it does in adults.

### Geriatric

Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing use of chlophedianol in the elderly with use in other age groups.

### Drug Interactions

Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.

### Other Interactions

Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.  Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur.  Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.

### Other Medical Problems

The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:

- Mucus or phlegm with cough—Since chlophedianol decreases coughing, it makes it difficult to get rid of the mucus that may collect in the lungs and airways with some diseases

## Proper Use
