You may need to have a skin test for tuberculosis before you start using this medicine. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your home has ever had a positive reaction to a tuberculosis test or has been exposed to tuberculosis.

Check with your doctor right away if you have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.

Immune-mediated problems (eg, colitis, skin reactions, lymphadenopathy) may occur while you are using this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you have the following symptoms: severe diarrhea, stomach pain, rash, blistering, crusting, irritation, itching, or reddening of the skin, or swollen, painful, or tender lymph glands in the neck, armpit, or groin.

This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema. These can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are using this medicine.

It is important to check with your doctor if you have any symptoms of an infection, such as fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, painful or difficult urination.

While you are being treated with daclizumab, and up to 4 months after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccines) without your doctor's approval. Daclizumab may lower your body's resistance and the vaccine may not work as well, or you might get the infection the vaccine is meant to prevent. In addition, you should not be around other persons living in your household who receive live virus vaccines because there is a chance they could pass the virus on to you. Some examples of live vaccines include measles, mumps, influenza (nasal flu vaccine), poliovirus (oral form), rotavirus, and rubella. Do not get close to them and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you have questions about this, talk to your doctor.
