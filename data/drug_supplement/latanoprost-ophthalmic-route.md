## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure this medicine is working properly and to check for unwanted effects.

If itching, redness, swelling, or other signs of eye or eyelid irritation occur, check with your doctor. These signs may mean that you are allergic to this medicine.

This medicine may cause blurred vision or other vision problems. If these occur, do not drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are not able to see well. If these eye changes are bothersome, check with your doctor.

While you are using latanoprost, the iris (colored part) of your treated eye may slowly become more brown in color.
