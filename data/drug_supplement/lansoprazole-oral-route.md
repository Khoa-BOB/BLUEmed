## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

First - Lansoprazole

Prevacid

Prevacid SoluTab

## Description

Lansoprazole is used to treat certain conditions where there is too much acid in the stomach. It is used to treat duodenal and gastric ulcers, gastric ulcers caused by NSAID use, erosive esophagitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is a condition wherein the acid in the stomach washes back up into the esophagus. Sometimes lansoprazole is used in combination with antibiotics (eg, amoxicillin, clarithromycin) to treat ulcers associated with an infection caused by H. pylori bacteria.

Lansoprazole is also used to treat Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES), which is a condition where the stomach produces too much acid.

Lansoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). It works by decreasing the amount of acid produced by the stomach.

This medicine is available both over-the-counter (OTC) and with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Capsule, Delayed Release
- Tablet Disintegrating, Delayed Release
- Powder for Suspension

Safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 1 year of age. This medicine may increase the risk for heart problems (eg, heart valve thickening) in children younger than 1 year of age.

Check with your doctor right away if you have a change in frequency of urination or amount of urine, blood in the urine, fever, joint pain, loss of appetite, skin rash, swelling of the body or feet and ankles, unusual tiredness or weakness, or unusual weight gain. These could be symptoms of a serious kidney problem called acute tubulointerstitial nephritis.

Taking this medicine for a long time may make it harder for your body to absorb vitamin B12. Tell your doctor if you have concerns about vitamin B12 deficiency.

Serious stomach conditions may occur while taking this medicine alone or together with antibiotics. Check with your doctor immediately if you or your child has stomach cramps, bloated feeling, watery and severe diarrhea which may also be bloody sometimes, fever, nausea or vomiting, or unusual tiredness or weakness.
