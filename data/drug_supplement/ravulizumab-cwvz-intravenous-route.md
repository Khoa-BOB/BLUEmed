## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of ravulizumab-cwvz injection in the elderly.

Ravulizumab-cwvz may increase your chance of having serious infections, including a meningococcal infection. Avoid people who are sick or have infections. Tell your doctor right away if you or your child develop headaches, nausea, vomiting, fever, a stiff neck or back, rash, confusion, muscle aches, or if your eyes have become sensitive to light. Make sure you have received a vaccine to prevent meningococcus infections at least 2 weeks before you receive this medicine. You may also be given antibiotic medicines to prevent infections if you are to use this medicine right away. If you have already received the meningococcal vaccine in the past, your doctor will decide if you need another dose.

Ask your doctor for a patient safety card. This card will list the symptoms of meningococcus infections and what to do if you have them. Carry the card with you at all times during treatment and for 8 months after your last dose. You will need to show the card to any doctor who treats you.

You could develop hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells) when you stop receiving this medicine for PNH. Your doctor will monitor you closely for at least 16 weeks after the last dose of this medicine. Be sure to keep all appointments.

Tell your doctor right away if you or your child start to have a fever, chills or shaking, dizziness, trouble breathing, itching or rash, lightheadedness or fainting after receiving this medicine.

You could also develop a condition called thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) when you or your child stop receiving this medicine for aHUS. Tell your doctor right away if you or your child have confusion, seizures, chest pain, trouble breathing, blood clots, or stroke.

Tell your doctor if you are also receiving other procedures (eg, plasma exchange, plasmapheresis) or medicines (eg, efgartigimod, immunoglobulin injection) for myasthenia gravis.
