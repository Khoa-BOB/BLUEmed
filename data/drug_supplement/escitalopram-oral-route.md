## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of escitalopram in children 12 years of age and older with depression. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children less than 12 years of age. Escitalopram may cause weight loss or a decrease in appetite. Teenagers who will be taking it for a long time should have their weight and growth measured on a regular basis.

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of escitalopram in children younger than 7 years of age with generalized anxiety disorder. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of escitalopram in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have hyponatremia (low sodium in the blood) and age-related liver problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving escitalopram.

Studies in women breastfeeding have demonstrated harmful infant effects. An alternative to this medication should be prescribed or you should stop breastfeeding while using this medicine.

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to allow for changes in your dose and to help reduce any side effects. Blood tests may be needed to check for any unwanted effects.

Do not take escitalopram with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor (eg, isocarboxazid [Marplan®], linezolid (Zyvox®), methylene blue injection, phenelzine [Nardil®], selegiline [Eldepryl®], tranylcypromine [Parnate®]). Do not start taking escitalopram during the 14 days after you stop a MAO inhibitor. Wait 14 days after stopping escitalopram before you start taking a MAO inhibitor. If you take them together or do not wait the proper amount of time, you may develop confusion, agitation, restlessness, stomach or bowel symptoms, a sudden high body temperature, an extremely high blood pressure, or severe seizures.

Do not take escitalopram with pimozide (Orap®). Using these medicines together can cause very serious heart problems .

Escitalopram may cause some teenagers and young adults to be agitated, irritable, or display other abnormal behaviors. It may also cause some people to have suicidal thoughts and tendencies or to become more depressed. Some people may have trouble sleeping, get upset easily, have a big increase in energy, or start to act reckless. If you or your caregiver notice any of these unwanted effects, tell your doctor right away. Let the doctor know if you or anyone in your family has bipolar disorder (manic-depressive) or has tried to commit suicide.

Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have anxiety, change or loss of consciousness, confusion as to time, place, or person, diarrhea, dizziness, dry mouth, extremely high fever or body temperature, holding false beliefs that cannot be changed by fact, hyperventilation, increased sweating, irregular heartbeats, irritability, muscle cramps, muscle twitching or jerking, nausea, pale, clammy skin, nervousness, redness of the face, neck, arms and occasionally, upper chest, restless, rhythmic movement of muscles, seeing, hearing, or feeling things that are not there, shakiness in the legs, arms, hands, or feet, trembling or shaking of the hands or feet, trouble breathing, trouble sleeping, or vomiting. These may be symptoms of a serious condition called serotonin syndrome. The risk may be higher if you or your child also take certain other medicines that affect the serotonin levels in the body. Do not use escitalopram with buspirone (Buspar®), fentanyl (Abstral®, Duragesic®), lithium (Eskalith®, Lithobid®), tryptophan, St. John's wort, amphetamines, or some pain or migraine medicines (eg, meperidine, methadone, rizatriptan, sumatriptan, tramadol, Demerol®, Frova®, Imitrex®, Maxalt®, Methadose®, Relpax®, Ultram®, Zomig®). Check with your doctor first before taking any other medicines with escitalopram .

Do not suddenly stop taking this medicine without checking first with your doctor . Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are taking before stopping it completely. This will decrease the chance of having withdrawal symptoms such as increased anxiety, burning or tingling feelings, confusion, dizziness, headache, irritability, nausea, trouble sleeping, or unusual tiredness or weakness.

This medicine may increase your risk for bleeding problems. Make sure your doctor knows if you are also taking other medicines that thin the blood, including aspirin, NSAIDs (eg, diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, Advil®, Aleve®, Celebrex®, Voltaren®), or warfarin (Coumadin®, Jantoven®).

This medicine may cause hyponatremia (low sodium in the blood). This is more common in elderly patients, those who are taking diuretic medicines for high blood pressure, or those who have decreased amounts of fluid in the body due to severe diarrhea or vomiting. Check with your doctor right away if you have confusion, headache, memory problems, trouble concentrating, weakness, or unsteadiness.

This medicine may cause some people to become drowsy, have trouble with thinking or controlling body movements. Make sure you know how you react to escitalopram before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are not alert or well-coordinated .

The use of alcohol is not recommended in patients who are taking escitalopram.

Check with your doctor right away if you have decreased interest in sexual intercourse, delayed or inability to have an orgasm, inability to have or keep an erection, or loss in sexual ability, desire, drive, or performance. These could be symptoms of sexual dysfunction.

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal (eg, St. John's wort) or vitamin supplements.
