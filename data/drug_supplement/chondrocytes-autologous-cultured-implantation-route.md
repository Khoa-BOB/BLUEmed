# Chondrocytes, autologous cultured (implantation route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Carticel

## Description

Autologous cultured chondrocytes are used, as part of an overall program (that includes knee surgery and special exercises), to help repair damaged knee cartilage caused by acute or repetitive trauma in patients who had not responded to a prior arthroscopic or other surgical repair procedure. Cartilage is a type of tissue that joins together and helps support parts of the body. Autologous cultured chondrocytes are the patient's own cartilage cells. The cells are removed from the patient and sent to a laboratory, where they are processed to increase their number. The cells are then implanted (placed) in the damaged part of the knee. After implantation, the chondrocytes help form new, healthy cartilage.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a trained doctor.

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines.

For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Geriatric

Although appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of Carticel® have not been performed in the geriatric population, geriatric-specific problems are not expected to limit the usefulness of Carticel® in the elderly.

### Breastfeeding

There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.

### Drug Interactions

Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.

### Other Interactions

Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.  Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur.  Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.

### Other Medical Problems

The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:

- Allergy to gentamicin or aminoglycoside antibiotics or
- Allergy to products made from cow—Should not be used in patients with these conditions.

- Cancer near the injured knee—It is not known whether removing and implanting the chondrocyte cells can affect the growth or spread of a nearby cancer.

## Proper Use

This medicine is to be given only by a doctor who have completed Vericel's Surgeon Training Program. Carticel® will be injected into your knee joint with a needle during surgery.

## Precautions

Your doctor will check your progress closely while you are receiving this medicine . This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to receive it and to check for unwanted effects.

Use crutches to help you walk for the first 6 to 8 weeks after receiving the implant.

After the implant surgery, your doctor will direct you to start a rehabilitation program that includes exercise. This program is a very important part of your treatment. You will be instructed to start out slowly and to increase gradually the number of times that you do each exercise. To get the most help from this program, it is very important that you follow the instructions as closely as possible. Do not do different exercises, and do not increase the number of times you do each exercise faster than directed . If pain or swelling occurs when you increase the amount of exercise you are doing, go back to the last level of exercise until the pain and swelling are gone, then try again. Use ice packs to help reduce the swelling.

Check with your doctor right away if sharp pain occurs in the knee that received the implant, or if “locking” of the knee occurs.

Autologous cultured chondrocytes are the patient's own cartilage cells. Patients undergoing surgical procedures using Carticel® are not routinely tested for transmissible infectious diseases and may increase risk to have them. Talk with your doctor about this risk if you are concerned.
