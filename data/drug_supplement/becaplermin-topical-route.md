## Precautions

Becaplermin works best when used with other methods for good wound care, such as not bearing weight on the leg that has the skin ulcer. Your doctor will discuss these methods with you.

Talk with your doctor whether you should continue using the medication if your skin ulcer has not reduced in size by 30% in 10 weeks or your skin ulcer has not improved after 20 weeks. If your skin ulcer does improve, your doctor may keep you on the medicine until the ulcer is completely healed.

It is important to use the proper amount and not to use more than prescribed. Using too much of this medicine may increase your risk of having cancer away from the application site. Your doctor will decide if you should continue to use this medicine based on how well your skin ulcer has healed.

If burning, itching, redness, skin rash, swelling, or soreness at the application site occurs, check with your doctor right away.
