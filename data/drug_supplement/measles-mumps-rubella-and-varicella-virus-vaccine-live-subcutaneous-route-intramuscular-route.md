# Measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella virus vaccine live (subcutaneous route, intramuscular route)

## Description

Measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella virus vaccine (live) is an active immunizing agent that is given to protect against infections caused by measles (rubeola), mumps, rubella (German measles), and varicella (chickenpox) viruses. The combination vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the virus.

Measles (also known as coughing measles, hard measles, morbilli, red measles, rubeola, and 10-day measles) is an infection that is easily spread from one person to another. Infection with measles can cause serious problems, such as stomach problems, pneumonia, ear infections, sinus problems, convulsions (seizures), brain damage, and possibly death. The risk of serious complications and death is greater for adults and infants than for children and teenagers.

Mumps is an infection that can cause serious problems, such as encephalitis and meningitis, which affect the brain. In addition, teenage boys and men are very susceptible to a condition, called orchitis, which causes pain and swelling in the testicles and scrotum, and in rare cases, sterility. Also, mumps infection can cause spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) in women during the first 3 months of pregnancy.

Rubella (also known as German measles) is a serious infection that causes miscarriages, stillbirths, or birth defects in unborn babies when pregnant women get the disease.

Varicella (commonly known as chickenpox) is an infection that is easily spread from one person to another. Chickenpox is usually a mild infection but can sometimes cause serious problems, such as pneumonia, inflammation of the brain, and a rare disease, called Reye's syndrome.

This vaccine is to be administered only by or under the supervision of your doctor or other healthcare professional.

## Proper Use

A nurse or other trained health professional will give your child this vaccine. It is given as a shot under your skin (usually in the upper arms or thighs) or into one of your muscles.

This vaccine is given in 2 doses. First dose is given at 12 to 15 months of age, while the second dose is given at 4 to 6 years of age.

Your child may receive certain other vaccines at the same time as this one, but in a different body area.

This vaccine comes with patient information leaflet. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions..

It is important to receive this vaccine at the proper time. If your child misses a scheduled shot, call your child's doctor to make another appointment as soon as possible.

## Precautions

It is very important that your child return to your doctor’s office at the right time if your child needs a second dose of the vaccine . Be sure to notify your doctor of any side effects that occur after your child receive this vaccine.

Do not become pregnant for 3 months after receiving this vaccine without first checking with your doctor . There is a chance that this vaccine may cause problems during pregnancy. If you think you have become pregnant, tell your doctor right away.

This vaccine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, a fast heartbeat, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after receiving the vaccine.

Proquad® injection will lower the number of some types of blood cells in your body. Because of this, you may bleed or get infections more easily. To help with these problems, avoid being near people who are sick or have infections. Wash your hands often. Stay away from rough sports or other situations where you could be bruised, cut, or injured. Brush and floss your teeth gently. Be careful when using sharp objects, including razors and fingernail clippers.

Children who have received this vaccine have developed a fever and in some cases a fever with seizures. Talk with your child's doctor if you have concerns about this.

Your child should avoid close contact with people at high risk for catching the varicella virus for 6 weeks after receiving this vaccine. People who are at risk for catching the virus are pregnant women, newborn babies, and anyone who has a weak immune system that keeps them from fighting infections.

Tell your doctor that you have received this vaccine:

- If you are to receive blood transfusions or other blood products within 3 months of receiving this vaccine.
- If you are to receive varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or other immune globulins within 3 to 5 months after receiving this vaccine.
- If you are to have a tuberculin skin test within 4 to 6 weeks after receiving this vaccine.
- If you are to receive any other live virus vaccines within 1 or 3 months of receiving this vaccine.

Do not take aspirin or medicines that contain aspirin (such as cold medicines) for 6 weeks after receiving this vaccine. Carefully check the label of any pain, headache, or cold medicine you give to your child to be sure it does not contain aspirin or salicylic acid.

This vaccine contains albumin, which comes from human blood. Some human blood products have transmitted certain viruses (eg, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease) to people who have received them. The risk of getting a virus from medicines made of human blood has been greatly reduced in recent years. This is the result of required testing of human donors for certain viruses, and testing during the manufacture of these medicines. Although the risk is low, talk with your child's doctor if you have concerns.

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
