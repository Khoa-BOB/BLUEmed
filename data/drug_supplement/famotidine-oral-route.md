## Description

Famotidine is used to treat stomach ulcers (gastric and duodenal), erosive esophagitis (heartburn or acid indigestion), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is a condition where the acid in the stomach washes back up into the esophagus. It is also used to treat certain conditions where there is too much acid in the stomach (eg, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, multiple endocrine neoplasia).

Famotidine belongs to the group of medicines known as histamine H2-receptor antagonists or H2-blockers. It works by decreasing the amount of acid produced by the stomach.

This medicine is available with your doctor's prescription and also without a prescription. For the prescription form, there is more medicine in each tablet. Your doctor will have special instructions on the proper use and dose for your medical problem.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
- Powder for Suspension

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of famotidine in children weighing 40 kilograms (kg) or more. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children to treat conditions causing too much stomach acid and to prevent an ulcer from coming back.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of famotidine in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving famotidine.
