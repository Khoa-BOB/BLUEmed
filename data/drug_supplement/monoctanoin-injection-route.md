# Monoctanoin (injection route)

## Description

Monoctanoin is used to dissolve cholesterol gallstones. Gallstones, which are found in the gallbladder or bile duct, sometimes remain in the bile duct even after the gallbladder has been removed by surgery. These stones may be too large to pass out of the body on their own. A catheter or tube is used to put the solution of monoctanoin into the bile duct where it will come in contact with the gallstone or gallstones and dissolve them. This process continues for 2 to 10 days.

Monoctanoin is administered only by or under the supervision of your doctor.
