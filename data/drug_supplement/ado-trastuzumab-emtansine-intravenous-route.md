# Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (intravenous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Kadcyla

## Description

Ado-trastuzumab emtansine injection is used to treat HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (cancer that has spread) in patients who have previously received other medicines (eg, trastuzumab, taxane medicine) that did not work well or whose cancer has returned during or within 6 months of completing treatment. It is also used as additional treatment in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer who have cancer left after a taxane medicine and trastuzumab-based treatment.

HER2 protein is produced by some breast tumors. Ado-trastuzumab emtansine interferes with the growth of this protein which also prevents tumor growth. The tumor cells will then be destroyed by the body.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Powder for Solution
