# Bupivacaine and meloxicam (injection route)

## Description

Bupivacaine and meloxicam combination injection is used to numb an area of your body and relieve pain for up to 72 hours after soft tissue surgery (eg, surgery in the breast, groin, or stomach) or muscle or bone surgery (eg, surgery in the foot, knee, shoulder, or spine). Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic. It causes a loss of feeling and prevents pain by blocking signals at the nerve endings. It does not cause loss of consciousness. Meloxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.
