## Brand Name

Effient

## Description

Prasugrel is used to prevent strokes, heart attacks, or other serious problems with your heart or blood vessels. It is given to patients before they have a heart procedure called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

A heart attack or stroke may occur when a blood vessel in the heart or brain is blocked by a blood clot. Prasugrel reduces the chance that a harmful blood clot will form by preventing certain cells in the blood from clumping or sticking together. Prasugrel may also increase the chance for serious bleeding in some people.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
