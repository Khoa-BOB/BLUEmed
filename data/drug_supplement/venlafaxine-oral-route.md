## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated any benefit to using venlafaxine in children. Studies have shown that some children, teenagers, and young adults think about suicide or attempt suicide when taking the medicine. Because of this toxicity, use in children is not recommended.

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of venlafaxine in the elderly.

## Precautions

If you will be taking this medicine for a long time, it is very important that your doctor check you at regular visits . This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to take it.

Do not take venlafaxine with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor (eg, isocarboxazid (Marplan®), phenelzine (Nardil®)], selegiline (Eldepryl®), tranylcypromine (Parnate®)). Do not start taking venlafaxine during the 14 days after you stop a MAO inhibitor and wait 7 days after stopping venlafaxine before you start taking a MAO inhibitor. If you take them together or do not wait the proper amount of time, you may develop confusion, agitation, restlessness, stomach or intestinal symptoms, a sudden high body temperature, an extremely high blood pressure, or severe seizures.

Venlafaxine may cause a serious condition called serotonin syndrome if taken together with certain medicines. Do not use venlafaxine with buspirone (Buspar®), fentanyl (Abstral®, Duragesic®), linezolid (Zyvox®), lithium (Eskalith®, Lithobid®), methylene blue injection, tryptophan, St John's wort, amphetamines, or some pain or migraine medicines (eg, meperidine, methadone, rizatriptan, sumatriptan, tramadol, Demerol®, Frova®, Imitrex®, Maxalt®, Methadose®, Relpax®, Ultram®, Zomig®). Check with your doctor first before taking any other medicines with venlafaxine .

This medicine may cause some teenagers and young adults to be agitated, irritable, or display other abnormal behaviors.

If you or your caregiver notice any of these unwanted effects, tell your doctor right away. Let the doctor know if you or anyone in your family has bipolar disorder (manic-depressive) or has tried to commit suicide.

Do not suddenly stop taking this medicine without checking first with your doctor . Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are taking before stopping it completely.
