## Proper Use

It is very important that you use this medicine only as directed . Do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may cause your skin to become irritated. You may need to use this medicine for several weeks or months before your skin starts to look better. Applying extra medicine will not make it work faster.

This medicine is for use on the skin only. Do not get it in your eyes, nose, or mouth. Do not use it on skin areas that have cuts or scrapes. If it does get on these areas, rinse it off right away.

To use:

- Wash your hands with soap and water before and after using this medicine.
- Before applying this medicine, wash the affected area(s) with warm water and mild soap. Rinse well and gently pat dry.
- Apply a small amount of the medicine, using enough to cover the affected area(s) of the skin (e.g., forehead, chin, cheeks, chest, shoulders), and gently rub it in. You should apply the medicine to the whole area usually affected by acne, not just to the pimples themselves.

After washing or shaving, it is best to wait 30 minutes before applying the medicine. The alcohol in the mixed medicine may irritate freshly washed or shaved skin.

Avoid washing the acne-affected area(s) too often. This may dry your skin and make your acne worse. Washing with a mild, bland soap 2 or 3 times a day should be enough, unless you have oily skin. If you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.

## Precautions

It is important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits . This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to use it.

This medicine may cause diarrhea, and in some cases it can be severe. Do not take any medicine to treat diarrhea without first checking with your doctor. Diarrhea medicines may make the diarrhea worse or make it last longer. If you have any questions about this or if mild diarrhea continues or gets worse, check with your doctor.

This medicine may make your skin more sensitive to sunlight. Use a sunscreen when you are outdoors. Avoid sunlamps and tanning beds. You may need to wear protective clothing, such as a hat.

If you develop severe swelling, shortness of breath, or any allergic reaction to this medicine, stop using the medicine and check with your doctor right away.

If your acne does not improve within 3 to 4 weeks, or if it becomes worse, check with your doctor. However, treatment of acne may take up to 8 to 12 weeks before you see full improvement.

If your doctor has ordered another medicine to be applied to the skin along with this medicine, it is best to apply the second medicine at least 1 hour after you apply the first medicine. This may help keep your skin from becoming too irritated. Also, if the medicines are used too close together, they may not work properly.

Mild stinging or burning of the skin may be expected after this medicine is applied. These effects may last up to a few minutes or more. If irritation continues, check with your doctor. You may have to use the medicine less often. Follow your doctor's directions.

You may continue to use cosmetics (make-up) while you are using this medicine for acne. However, it is best to use only ``oil-free'' cosmetics. Also, it is best not to use cosmetics too heavily or too often. They may make your acne worse. If you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.

Do not use any other medicines on the treated skin areas without asking your doctor. Avoid using any skin care products that can dry or irritate your skin. These include skin peeling agents.

Do not apply the medicine to your hair or to any colored fabric. This medicine may cause bleaching.
