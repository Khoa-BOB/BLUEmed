## Description

Dolutegravir is used together with other medicines for the treatment of the infection caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in patients who have not received anti-HIV medicines in the past or to replace their current anti-HIV medicines. HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Dolutegravir tablets are also used together with rilpivirine in adults to replace their current anti-HIV medicines when their healthcare provider determines that they meet certain requirements.

Dolutegravir will not cure or prevent HIV infection or AIDS, however, it helps keep HIV from reproducing and appears to slow down the destruction of the immune system. This may help delay the development of problems that usually result from AIDS or HIV disease. Dolutegravir will not keep you from spreading HIV to other people. People who receive this medicine may continue to have some of the problems usually related to AIDS or HIV disease.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
