## Proper Use

This medicine is usually given by your doctor. However, medicines given by injection are sometimes used at home. If you will be using this medicine at home, your doctor will teach you how the injections are to be given. Be sure you understand exactly how the medicine is to be injected.

This medicine comes with a Medication Guide. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.

This medicine may be given as a shot under your skin (usually in the upper arms, thighs, or stomach) or into a vein. If your doctor tells you to inject it a certain way, follow your doctor's instructions.

If you are giving this medicine at home:

- Use a new needle and unopened syringe each time you inject your medicine.
- Do not use more medicine or use it more often than your doctor tells you to.
- You will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Do not inject into moles or areas that are tender, red, bruised, hard, or has scars, stretch marks, not intact, or that could be irritated by a belt or waistband. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. This will help prevent skin problems from the injections.

- Do not save any leftover medicine from an open syringe. Use each syringe only 1 time.

People with kidney problems need to be on a special diet. Also, people with high blood pressure (which may be caused by kidney disease or by Mircera® treatment) may need to be on a special diet or take medicine to keep their blood pressure under control. After their anemia has been corrected, some people feel so much better that they want to eat more than before. To keep your kidney disease or your high blood pressure from getting worse, it is very important that you follow your special diet and you take your medicines regularly , even if you are feeling better.

In addition to Mircera®, your body needs iron and vitamins to make red blood cells. Your doctor may direct you to take iron or vitamin supplements. Be sure to follow your doctor's orders carefully.
