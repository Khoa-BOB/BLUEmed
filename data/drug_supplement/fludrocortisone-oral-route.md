## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Pediatric

Fludrocortisone may slow or stop growth in children or growing adolescents when used for a long time.
