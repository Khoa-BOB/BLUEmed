# Penpulimab-kcqx (intravenous route)

## Description

Penpulimab-kcqx injection is used in combination with either cisplatin or carboplatin and gemcitabine as first-line treatment of non-keratinizing nasopharyngeal carcinoma (nose and throat cancer) that has spread throughout the body (metastatic) or has returned. It is also used alone to treat non-keratinizing nasopharyngeal carcinoma in patients who have received other cancer medicines (eg, platinum) that did not work well or no longer working, or whose cancer has spread.

Penpulimab-kcqx is a monoclonal antibody that changes the immune system to help control the growth of cancer cells.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.
