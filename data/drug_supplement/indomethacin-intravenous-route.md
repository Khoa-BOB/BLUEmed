# Indomethacin (intravenous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Indocin

## Description

Indomethacin injection is used to treat patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in premature infants (babies born too early) who weigh between 500 and 1750 grams. PDA is a heart problem where a blood vessel, the ductus arteriosus, fails to close normally after birth. This blood vessel is only used before birth, and is no longer needed after the baby is born. Indomethacin injection works by causing the PDA to constrict, and this closes the blood vessel. This medicine is used when other medical treatment for PDA fails after 48 hours.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Powder for Solution

## Proper Use

A nurse or other trained health professional will give this medicine to your baby. This medicine is given through a needle placed in one of your baby's veins.

## Precautions

Indomethacin injection may change how the body reacts during an infection. Your baby's doctor will monitor your baby for any signs of infection (e.g., fever, chills, or other unusual behavior).

This medicine may affect the action of platelets, which are necessary for clotting the blood. This may increase the chance of bleeding for your baby. Your baby's doctor will monitor your baby for any unusual bleeding or bruising, any dark-colored urine or stools, or other signs of bleeding in your baby.

This medicine may decrease your baby's urine volume. This may increase your baby's chance of having kidney problems or low sodium in the blood (hyponatremia). Blood and urine tests will be needed to check for any signs of these risks.

Liver problems may occur while your baby is receiving this medicine. Stop using this medicine and check with your baby's doctor right away if your baby is having more than one of these symptoms: abdominal pain or tenderness; clay-colored stools; dark urine; decreased appetite; fever; headache; itching; loss of appetite; nausea and vomiting; skin rash; swelling of the feet or lower legs; unusual tiredness or weakness; or yellow eyes or skin.

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
