# Pralatrexate (intravenous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Folotyn

## Description

Pralatrexate injection is used to treat peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) in patients who have already been treated with other medicines that did not work well. Peripheral T-cell lymphoma is a rare type of cancer that affects certain white blood cells and causes enlarged and swollen lymph nodes in the neck, armpits, and groin.

Pralatrexate belongs to the group of medicines called antineoplastics (cancer medicines). It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal cells may also be affected by the medicine, other unwanted effects may also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor.

This medicine is to be administered only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Solution

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals.

### Pediatric

You must start taking 1 to 1.25 milligrams (mg) of folic acid every day for at least 10 days before your first dose. You must keep taking folic acid every day during therapy and for 30 days after your last pralatrexate dose. You can get folic acid as a nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) product. Ask your doctor for help in choosing a folic acid product.

Your doctor will also give you vitamin B12 injections during your treatment with pralatrexate to lower your chances of harmful side effects. You will get your first injection about 10 weeks before your first dose, and additional injections about every 8 to 10 weeks during therapy.

Pralatrexate can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:

- If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor right away if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.
- Check with your doctor right away if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising; black, tarry stools; blood in the urine or stools; or pinpoint red spots on your skin.
- Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.
- Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.
- Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.

This medicine may cause mucositis, which is redness or sores on the inside of the mouth or tongue. Check with your doctor right away if you have cracked lips, diarrhea, difficulty with swallowing, or sores, ulcers, or white spots on the lips, tongue, or inside of the mouth while you are receiving this medicine.

Serious skin reactions can occur with this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you have blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin; red skin lesions; severe acne or skin rash; sores or ulcers on the skin; or fever or chills while you are receiving this medicine.

This medicine may cause a serious type of reaction called tumor lysis syndrome. Your doctor may give you a medicine to help prevent this. Call your doctor right away if you have a decrease or change in urine amount; joint pain, stiffness, or swelling; lower back, side, or stomach pain; a rapid weight gain; swelling of the feet or lower legs; or unusual tiredness or weakness.
