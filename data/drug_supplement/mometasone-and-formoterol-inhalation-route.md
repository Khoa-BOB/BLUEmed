# Mometasone and formoterol (inhalation route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Dulera

## Description

Mometasone and formoterol is a combination of two medicines that are used to treat asthma and improve lung function. It is used when a patient's asthma has not been controlled sufficiently on other asthma medicines, or when a patient's condition is so severe that more than one medicine is needed every day. This medicine will not relieve an asthma attack that has already started.

Mometasone belongs to the family of medicines known as corticosteroids (cortisone-like medicines). It works by preventing inflammation (swelling) in the lungs that causes an asthma attack.

Formoterol belongs to the family of medicines known as adrenergic bronchodilators. Adrenergic bronchodilators are medicines that are breathed in through the mouth to open up the bronchial tubes (air passages) in the lungs. They relieve cough, shortness of breath, and troubled breathing by increasing the flow of air through the bronchial tubes.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Aerosol Powder

This medicine is used with a special inhaler and usually comes with patient directions or a Medication Guide. Read the directions carefully before using this medicine. If you do not understand the directions or you are not sure how to use the inhaler, ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you what to do.

When you use the inhaler for the first time, or if you have not used it for 5 days or longer, it may not deliver the right amount of medicine with the first puff. Before using the inhaler, prime it by spraying the medicine 4 times into the air away from the face, and shaking it well before each spray.

How to use this medicine:

- Take the inhaler out of the carton before you use it for the first time.
- Do not use the inhaler for this medicine with any other medicine.
- Remove the cap from the mouthpiece of the actuator.

- While pressing down firmly and fully on the blue top of the inhaler, breathe in through your mouth as deeply as you can until you have taken a full deep breath.
- Repeat these steps for the next puff, starting with shaking the inhaler.
