# Pertuzumab (intravenous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Perjeta

## Description

Pertuzumab injection is used in combination with other cancer medicines (eg, trastuzumab, docetaxel) to treat HER2-positive metastatic (cancer that has spread) breast cancer in patients who have not received an anti-HER2 treatment for metastatic breast cancer. This medicine is also used with other cancer medicines (eg, trastuzumab) as a neoadjuvant treatment (before surgery) of HER2-positive, locally advanced (cancer that has spread to areas near the breast), inflammatory (swelling), or early stage breast cancer (tumor is greater than 2 centimeters in diameter or node positive) as part of a complete treatment plan for early breast cancer. It is also used as an adjuvant treatment (after surgery) of HER2-positive early breast cancer that has a high risk of coming back. Your doctor will test for the presence of the HER2 protein or HER2 gene. HER2 protein is produced by some tumors.

Pertuzumab is a monoclonal antibody. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by pertuzumab, other effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Solution
