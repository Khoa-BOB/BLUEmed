## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

## Description

Filgrastim-txid injection is used to treat neutropenia (low white blood cells) that is caused by cancer medicines. It is a synthetic (man-made) form of a substance that is naturally produced in your body called a colony stimulating factor. Filgrastim-txid helps the bone marrow to make new white blood cells.

When certain cancer medicines are used to fight cancer cells, they also affect the white blood cells that fight infections. Filgrastim-txid is used to prevent or reduce the risk of infections while you are being treated with cancer medicines. This medicine is also used to help the bone marrow recover after a bone marrow transplantation, for a process called peripheral blood progenitor cell collection in cancer patients.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
