## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits for any problems or unwanted effects that may be caused by this medicine. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

You may get infections more easily while you are receiving this medicine. Avoid people who are sick or have infections. Call your doctor right away if you start to have signs of an infection such as a cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, painful or difficult urination, fever or chills, shortness of breath, or flu-like symptoms such as a runny or stuffy nose, headache, or feeling generally ill.

A small number of people who used this medicine developed cancer. This was rare and most of the cases were skin cancer. Make sure your doctor knows if you have had cancer before. Talk about this risk with your doctor.

This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis, angioedema (swelling), and severe itching. These reactions can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, hives or welts, itching, hoarseness, redness of the skin, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, mouth, or throat after you receive the medicine.

You should contact your doctor right away if you develop constant nausea, a loss of appetite, unusual tiredness or weakness, vomiting, abdominal or stomach pain, yellow eyes or skin, easy bruising, dark urine, or pale stools. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.

Female patients: Tell your doctor if you become pregnant while you are receiving this medicine or within 8 weeks after your last dose.

While you are being treated with alefacept injection and after you stop using it, do not have any immunizations (vaccines) without your doctor's approval. Alefacept may lower your body's resistance and there is a chance you might get the infection the immunization is meant to prevent.
