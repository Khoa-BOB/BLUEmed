## Description

Leuprolide injection is a synthetic (man-made) hormone that is similar to a natural hormone that is produced in the brain. It is used to treat a number of medical problems including:

- Anemia caused by bleeding from uterine leiomyomas (fibroid tumors in the uterus), or
- Cancer of the prostate that is advanced or late-stage, or
- Central precocious puberty, a condition which causes early puberty in males (before 9 years of age) and females (before 8 years of age), or
- Pain due to endometriosis.

Lupron Depot® 3.75 mg and Lupron Depot® 11.25 mg are used in combination with norethindrone acetate to initially relieve and manage the reoccurrence of the painful symptoms of endometriosis. It is also used together with iron to treat bleeding in patients with anemia caused by uterine leiomyomas before a surgical procedure. It is given to females who need 3 months of hormonal suppression.

When given regularly to males, leuprolide decreases testosterone levels. Reducing the amount of testosterone in the body helps treat cancer of the prostate.

When given regularly to females, leuprolide decreases estrogen levels. Reducing the amount of estrogen in the body helps treat endometriosis. Leuprolide will also shrink tumors in the uterus, which decreases vaginal bleeding and helps prevent anemia.

When given regularly to males and females who have early puberty, leuprolide slows the development of the genital area for both sexes. Leuprolide will also slow breast development in females. This medicine will delay puberty only as long as the child continues to receive it.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Emulsion
- Powder for Suspension, 4 Month
- Solution
- Powder for Suspension, 6 Month
- Powder for Suspension, 1 Month

### Geriatric
