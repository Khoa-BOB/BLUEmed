## Description

Nicotine oral chewing gum and lozenges are used to help you stop smoking. Nicotine is absorbed from the gum or lozenge in the mouth and enters the blood stream. This replaces the nicotine you would get from smoking and makes the withdrawal effects from not smoking less severe. The amount of nicotine is decreased over time until use is stopped.

This medicine is available without a prescription, but proof of age (18 years or older) is required.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Gum
- Lozenge/Troche

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of oral nicotine in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established. Small amounts of nicotine can cause serious unwanted effects in children, and lozenges or gum contain enough nicotine to cause problems, including used pieces.

In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.

Chewing gum :

- If you have the urge to smoke, slowly chew one piece of gum until you notice a peppery taste or feel a slight tingling in your mouth.

- Do not drink acidic beverages, such as citrus fruit juices, coffee, soft drinks, or tea within 15 minutes before or while chewing a piece of gum.
- As your urge to smoke becomes less frequent, gradually reduce the pieces of gum used. Follow the dosing instructions on the label.

Lozenges :

- Do not eat or drink for 15 minutes before using a lozenge.
- If you have the urge to smoke, slowly suck one lozenge until it dissolves.
- Do not bite or chew the lozenge like hard candy. Do not swallow the lozenge. Try not to swallow most of the dissolved medicine.
