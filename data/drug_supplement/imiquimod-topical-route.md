Imiquimod topical is used to treat external warts around the genital and rectal areas called condyloma acuminatum. It is not used on warts inside the vagina, penis, or rectum. Imiquimod is also used to treat a skin condition of the face and scalp called actinic keratosis (AK), which is caused by too much sun exposure.

Stop using this medicine and check with your doctor right away if you or your child have a skin rash, burning, pain, redness, swelling, bleeding, oozing, scabbing, or peeling on the skin where the medicine was applied.

Stop using this medicine and check with your doctor right away if you have severe swelling near the opening of the vagina. This may cause painful urination, trouble in passing urine, or not able to urinate.

Stop using this medicine and check with your doctor right away if you or your child have severe skin irritation or flu-like symptoms, such as diarrhea, fever, chills, headache, nausea, muscle or joint pain, or unusual tiredness or weakness.

Avoid exposing your skin to sunlight, sunlamps, or tanning beds while you are using this medicine. Always use sunscreen or sun-blocking lotions and wear protective clothing and hats.

If you are being treated for external warts, avoid having genital, oral, or anal sex while the medicine is on your skin.
