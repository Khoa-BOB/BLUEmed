## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines.

Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Using this medicine during the later part of a pregnancy may cause problems in your newborn baby (eg, sedation or withdrawal symptoms). Tell your doctor right away if your baby has an abnormal sleep pattern, diarrhea, feeding problems, a high-pitched cry, irritability, low muscle tone, restlessness, shakiness or tremors, sluggishness, trouble breathing, weight loss, vomiting, or fails to gain weight. If you think you have become pregnant while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away.

This medicine may be habit-forming. If you feel that the medicine is not working as well, do not use more than your prescribed dose. Call your doctor for instructions.

If you develop any unusual and strange thoughts or behavior while you are taking lorazepam be sure to discuss it with your doctor. Some changes that have occurred in people taking this medicine are like those seen in people who drink alcohol and then act in a manner that is not normal. Other changes may be more unusual and extreme, such as confusion, worsening of depression, hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or feeling things that are not there), thoughts of killing oneself, and unusual excitement, nervousness, or irritability.

This medicine may cause drowsiness, trouble with thinking, trouble with controlling movements, or trouble with seeing clearly. Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are not alert or able to think or see well .

Symptoms of an overdose include: blurred vision, change in consciousness, confusion, dizziness, faintness, or lightheadedness when getting up suddenly from a lying or sitting position, hallucinations, increased sweating, loss of consciousness, loss of strength or energy, muscle pain or weakness, nightmares, shakiness and unsteady walk, slow or irregular heartbeat, sweating, trouble in speaking, unsteadiness, trembling, or other problems with muscle control or coordination, trouble sleeping, unusual excitement, nervousness, restlessness, or irritability, or unusual tiredness or weakness . Call your doctor right away if you notice these symptoms.
