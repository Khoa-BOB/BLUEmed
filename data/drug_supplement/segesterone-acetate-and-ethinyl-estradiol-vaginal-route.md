# Segesterone acetate and ethinyl estradiol (vaginal route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Annovera

## Description

Segesterone acetate and ethinyl estradiol combination is used to prevent pregnancy. It is a flexible birth control vaginal system (in the shape of a ring) that contains two types of hormones, segesterone acetate and ethinyl estradiol. It works by stopping a woman's egg from fully developing each month. The egg can no longer accept a sperm and fertilization (pregnancy) is prevented.

No contraceptive method is 100 percent effective. Birth control methods such as having surgery to become sterile or not having sex are more effective than vaginal systems. Discuss your options for birth control with your doctor.

This medicine will not prevent HIV infection or other sexually transmitted diseases. It will not help as emergency contraception, such as after unprotected sexual contact.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Insert, Extended Release

## Proper Use

Use this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor . Do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may cause unwanted side effects.

This medicine is to be used only in the vagina . This combination medicine is contained in a vaginal system that is placed into your vagina. The vaginal system will slowly release small amounts of the medicine for your body to absorb.

This medicine comes with a patient information leaflet and patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.

This medicine is used in a 4 week cycle for 13 cycles (1 year). You may start using the vaginal system between the second and fifth day of your menstrual period, keeping it in place for 3 weeks.

Once the vaginal system is in place inside your vagina, you should not be able to feel it. If you feel uncomfortable, it may not be inserted far enough. Gently push the vaginal system farther into your vagina. If you feel pain, talk to your doctor.

The vaginal system may move down accidently. This can happen if you remove a tampon, during sex, or strain to have a bowel movement. Gently push it back into place. If the vaginal system comes all the way out, wash it with mild soap and warm water, pat it dry with a clean cloth towel or paper towel, and put it back inside. Call your doctor if the vaginal system comes out several times.

Remove the vaginal system after 3 weeks on the same day of the week and time it was inserted. During the 1-week break, you will usually have your menstrual period. Wash the vaginal system with mild soap and warm water, pat it dry with a clean cloth towel or paper towel, and keep it inside the case that comes with it. Reinsert it after a week.

While using this medicine, you may need to use an additional form of birth control method (eg, condom, spermicide) during the first 7 days to prevent pregnancy, especially if you have an irregular menstrual cycle or if you start using this vaginal system more than 5 days from your last menstrual bleeding.

If you need to remove the vaginal system, hook your finger through it and pull it out.

If you are switching from a combination hormonal method (eg, pills, patch) to Annovera™ , start using this medicine on any day. Do not use this medicine after more than 7 hormone-free days.

If you are switching from a progestin-only method (eg, progestin-only implant, injection, intrauterine system, pill) to Annovera™ , start using it on the day after you used your last progestin-only pill, or on the day your implant or IUD is removed, or on the day you would have your next injection. You must also use an additional barrier method of birth control (eg, male condom with spermicide) for the first 7 days.

Do not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while you are using this medicine. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice may change the amount of this medicine that is absorbed in the body.
