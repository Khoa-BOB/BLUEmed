## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Although there is no specific information comparing use of sodium thiosulfate in children with use in other age groups, this medicine is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in children than it does in adults.

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of Pedmark® in children younger than 1 month of age or in children with cancer that has spread (metastatic). Safety and efficacy have not been established.

Use in children younger than 1 month of age is not recommended because Pedmark® may increase the risk of hypernatremia (high sodium levels in the blood).

### Geriatric

Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults. Although there is no specific information comparing the use of sodium thiosulfate in the elderly with use in other age groups, this medicine is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in older people than it does in younger adults.

No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of Pedmark® in geriatric patients.

In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.

### Other Interactions
