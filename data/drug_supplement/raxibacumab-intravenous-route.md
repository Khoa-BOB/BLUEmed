## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Raxibacumab

## Description

Raxibacumab injection is given with antibiotic medicines to treat inhalational anthrax. It is also used to prevent inhalational anthrax when there are no other available treatments. It works by preventing the anthrax bacteria from entering the body's cells, which prevents an infection.

Anthrax is a serious disease that may cause death. It is spread by touching or eating something that is infected with the anthrax germ, such as animals, or by breathing in the anthrax germ.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.
