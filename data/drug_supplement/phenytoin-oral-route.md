Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines.

### Pediatric

It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:

- If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.

If you, your child, or your caregiver notice any of these side effects, tell your doctor right away.

In some patients (usually younger patients), tenderness, swelling, or bleeding of the gums (gingival hyperplasia) may appear soon after phenytoin treatment is started. To help prevent this, brush and floss your teeth carefully and regularly and massage your gums. Also, see your dentist every 6 months to have your teeth cleaned. If you have any questions about how to take care of your teeth and gums, or if you notice any tenderness, swelling, or bleeding of your gums, check with your doctor or dentist.
