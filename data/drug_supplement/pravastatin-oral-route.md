# Pravastatin (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Pravachol

## Description

Pravastatin is used together with a proper diet to lower cholesterol and triglycerides (fat) in the blood. This medicine may help prevent or slow down medical problems, like atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), that are caused by fats clogging the blood vessels. It may also be used to prevent certain types of heart and blood vessel problems in patients with risk factors for heart problems.

Pravastatin belongs to the group of medicines called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, or statins. It works by blocking an enzyme that is needed by the body to make cholesterol, so this reduces the amount of cholesterol in the blood.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
