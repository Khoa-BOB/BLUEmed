# Protirelin (intravenous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Thyrel TRH

## Description

Protirelin is used to test the response of the anterior pituitary gland in people who may have certain medical conditions involving the thyroid gland. Testing with this medicine may help to identify the problem or may ensure that the dose of medicine being used is correct.

Protirelin stimulates release of a hormone called thyroid-stimulating hormone or TSH from the anterior pituitary gland. TSH then stimulates the thyroid gland. By measuring the amount of TSH in the blood after protirelin is given, the doctor can determine how well the anterior pituitary is working.

How test is done: First, a sample of your blood is taken. Then protirelin is given by injection by your doctor. The dose of protirelin may be different for different patients. Adults are usually given 500 micrograms (mcg) injected into a vein. The dose for children is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor. A little while after the dose is given, one or more blood samples are taken. Then the results of the test are studied. You will be asked to lie down before, during, and for 15 minutes after the test. This is to prevent dizziness and possible fainting.

Protirelin is to be used only under the supervision of a doctor.
