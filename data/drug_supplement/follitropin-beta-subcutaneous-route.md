## Description

Follitropin beta injection is used to treat infertility in both men and women. This medicine is a man-made hormone called follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). FSH is produced in the body by the pituitary gland. FSH helps to develop eggs in the ovaries of women and sperm in the testes of men. Follitropin beta replaces natural FSH in the body.

Follitropin beta injection is used as a fertility medicine to develop eggs in women who have not been able to become pregnant because of problems with ovulation. Also, many women wanting to become pregnant will use this medicine while enrolled in a fertility program called Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART). ART uses procedures such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) or embryo transfer (ET). Follitropin beta is used together with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in these procedures.

Follistim® AQ Cartridge is also used in women with healthy ovaries who are undergoing reproductive procedures such as IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycle. This medicine is used together with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in these procedures.

Follitropin beta is also used as a fertility medicine to help men with low sperm counts produce more sperms. Treatment with human chorionic gonadotropin should come before treatment with follitropin beta.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
