You should not use this medicine if you are also taking tenofovir (Viread®) or other medicines containing tenofovir (eg, Atripla®, Complera®, Stribild™, or Truvada®). Tell your doctor right away if you are using any of these medicines. Do not start using adefovir until your doctor tells you to.

If you have or get HIV infection, be sure to discuss your treatment with your doctor. If you are using this medicine to treat chronic hepatitis B, and are not taking medicine for your HIV infection at the same time, some HIV treatments may be less likely to work. You may need to get an HIV test before you start using this medicine, and again later if there is a chance you were exposed to HIV. This medicine will not help your HIV infection.

These may be symptoms of a serious kidney problem.

Two rare but serious reactions to this medicine are lactic acidosis (build-up of acid in the blood) and liver toxicity, including an enlarged liver.

Call your doctor right away if you have stomach discomfort or cramping, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, muscle cramping or pain, unusual tiredness or weakness, trouble breathing, or a yellowish color in your skin or eyes.
