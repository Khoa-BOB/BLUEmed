## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of risperidone injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

### Geriatric

Elderly patients may be especially sensitive to the effects of risperidone. This may increase the chance of having side effects during treatment. This medicine should not be used for behavioral problems in older adults with dementia.

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of risperidone injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving risperidone injection.
