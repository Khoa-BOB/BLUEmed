## Description

Lidocaine topical jelly or ointment is used on different parts of the body to cause numbness or loss of feeling for patients having certain medical procedures. It is also used to relieve pain and itching caused by conditions such as sunburn or other minor burns, insect bites or stings, poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, minor cuts, or scratches. Xylocaine® jelly is used to treat painful urethritis (inflammation of the urethra). It is also used to prevent and control pain in procedures involving the male and female urethra. Xylocaine® jelly is also used to lubricate the nose, mouth, and throat for intubation.

Lidocaine viscous topical solution is also used to treat sore mouth or throat and also reduce gagging during the taking of X-ray pictures and dental impressions.

Lidocaine skin patch is used to relieve nerve pain caused by herpes zoster or shingles (postherpetic neuralgia).

Lidocaine belongs to the family of medicines called local anesthetics. This medicine prevents pain by blocking the signals at the nerve endings in the skin. This medicine does not cause unconsciousness as general anesthetics do when used for surgery.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Spray

### Pediatric

Because of this medicine's toxicity, it should be used with extreme caution in children younger than 3 years of age, only after other medicines have been considered or found ineffective.

### Geriatric
