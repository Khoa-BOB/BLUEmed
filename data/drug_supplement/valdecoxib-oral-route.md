Valdecoxib is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (also called NSAIDs) are used to relieve some symptoms caused by arthritis (rheumatism), such as inflammation, swelling, stiffness, and joint pain. However, this medicine does not cure arthritis and will help you only as long as you continue to take it. It may also be used to treat pain associated with menstrual periods.

This medicine was available only with your doctor's prescription.

Valdecoxib was voluntarily withdrawn from the U.S. market on April 7, 2005 due to safety concerns of increased risk of serious heart problems and skin reactions .
