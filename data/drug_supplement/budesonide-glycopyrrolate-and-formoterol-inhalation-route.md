# Budesonide, glycopyrrolate, and formoterol (inhalation route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Breztri Aerosphere

## Description

Budesonide, glycopyrrolate, and formoterol combination is used as long-term maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. This medicine helps improve and reduce the number of flare-ups of the symptoms of COPD.

Inhaled budesonide belongs to the family of medicines known as corticosteroids (cortisone-like medicines). It works by preventing inflammation (swelling) in the lungs that causes an asthma attack.

Glycopyrrolate and formoterol are long-acting bronchodilators. Bronchodilators are medicines that are breathed in through the mouth to open up the bronchial tubes (air passages) in the lungs. They relieve cough, wheezing, and trouble breathing by increasing the flow of air through the bronchial tubes.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Aerosol Liquid

## Proper Use

Use this medicine only as directed by your doctor . Do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. Do not stop using this medicine without telling your doctor. To do so may make your condition worse.

This medicine comes with a patient information leaflet or patient instructions. Read the instructions carefully before using this medicine. If you do not understand the directions or you are not sure how to use the inhaler, have your doctor show you what to do. Also, ask your doctor to check how you use the inhaler to make sure you are using it properly.

When you use the inhaler for the first time, it may not deliver the right amount of medicine with the first puff. Therefore, before using the inhaler, prime it by spraying the medicine 4 times into the air away from the face, and shaking it well before each spray. If you have not used it for 7 days or longer or if you've dropped it, re-prime by spraying the medicine 2 times into the air away from the face, and shaking it well before each spray.

To use the inhaler:

- This medicine comes in a sealed foil pouch. Do not open the foil pouch until you are ready to use a dose of this medicine.
- Once opened, remove the inhaler from the pouch.
- Take the cap off the mouthpiece. Check the mouthpiece to make sure it is clear.
- Press the center of the dose indicator all the way down and release it. You may hear a soft click from the dose indicator as it counts down during use.
- To inhale this medicine, breathe out fully and try to get as much air out of your lungs as possible. Put your lips tightly around the mouthpiece and breathe in quickly and deeply until the canister stops moving in the actuator and a puff of medicine has been released.
- Remove the inhaler from your mouth and hold your breath for as long as is comfortable, and then breathe out slowly through your nose.
- Gargle and rinse your mouth with water after each dose. This will help prevent hoarseness, throat irritation, and infection in the mouth. Do not swallow the water after rinsing.
- Clean the inhaler 1 time each week by taking the canister out of the actuator and allow warm water to run through it for about 30 seconds. Turn the actuator upside down and rinse again for about 30 seconds. Let the actuator air-dry overnight.

The dose display window of the inhaler will turn red when the inhaler has 20 or fewer doses left. Throw the inhaler when it reaches 0, or if it has been 3 weeks (for the 28 inhalation canister) or 3 months (for the 120 inhalation canister) since you last opened the foil pouch.
