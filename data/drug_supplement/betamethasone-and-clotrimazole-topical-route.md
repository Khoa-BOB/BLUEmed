Using too much of this medicine or using it for a long time may increase your risk of having adrenal gland problems. The risk is greater for children and patients who use large amounts for a long time. Talk to your doctor right away if you have more than one of these symptoms while you are using this medicine: blurred vision, dizziness or fainting, a fast, irregular, or pounding heartbeat, increased thirst or urination, irritability, or unusual tiredness or weakness.

Check with your doctor right away if you have a skin rash, burning, stinging, swelling, redness, or irritation on the skin.

Check with your doctor right away if blurred vision, difficulty with reading, or any other change in vision occurs during or after treatment. Your doctor may want your eyes be checked by an ophthalmologist (eye doctor).

Do not use cosmetics or other skin care products on the treated areas.

To help clear up your skin infection completely and to help make sure it does not return, the following good health habits are important:

- For patients using this medicine for athlete's foot: Carefully dry the feet, especially between the toes, after bathing. Avoid wearing socks made from wool or synthetic materials (eg, rayon or nylon). Instead, wear clean, cotton socks and change them daily or more often if your feet sweat freely. Wear well-ventilated shoes (eg, shoes with holes) or sandals. Use a bland, absorbent powder (eg, talcum powder) or an antifungal powder freely between the toes, on the feet, and in socks and shoes once or twice a day. Be sure to use the powder after clotrimazole and betamethasone combination cream has been applied and has disappeared into the skin. Do not use the powder as the only treatment for your fungus infection. These measures will help keep the feet cool and dry.
- For patients using this medicine for jock itch: Carefully dry the groin area after bathing. Avoid wearing underwear that is tight-fitting or made from synthetic materials (eg, rayon or nylon). Instead, wear loose-fitting, cotton underwear. Use a bland, absorbent powder (eg, talcum powder) or an antifungal powder freely once or twice a day. Be sure to use the powder after clotrimazole and betamethasone combination cream has been applied and has disappeared into the skin. Do not use the powder as the only treatment for your fungus infection. These measures will help reduce chafing and irritation and will also help keep the groin area cool and dry.
- For patients using this medicine for ringworm of the body: Carefully dry yourself after bathing. Avoid too much heat and humidity if possible. Try to keep moisture from building up on affected areas of the body. Wear well-ventilated clothing.
