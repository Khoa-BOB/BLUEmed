## Description

Diphenoxylate and atropine combination is used along with other measures (eg, fluid and electrolyte treatment) to treat severe diarrhea. Diphenoxylate helps stop diarrhea by slowing down the movements of the intestines.

Diphenoxylate is chemically related to some narcotics and may be habit-forming if taken in doses that are larger than prescribed. If higher than normal doses of the combination are taken, the atropine will cause unpleasant effects.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
