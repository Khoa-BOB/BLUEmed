This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

This medicine comes with a Medication Guide. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress while you are receiving this medicine and during the MRI scan to make sure this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

This medicine should not be given intrathecally (injection given through the spinal canal). It may cause serious unwanted effects including agitation, back pain, blurred vision, change or loss of consciousness, confusion, death, dizziness, drowsiness, fever, hallucinations, headache, irritability, mood or metal changes, seizures, stiff neck, unusual tiredness or weakness, or vomiting when given intrathecally.

Check with your doctor or nurse right away if you or your child have burning or itching of the skin, deep bone pain in the hips or ribs, joint stiffness, a limited range of motion in the arms and legs, muscle weakness, red or dark patches on the skin of the arms or legs, or skin swelling, hardening, or tightening within the first few days or weeks after you receive this medicine. These may be symptoms of a very serious disease called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF).

This medicine may increase your risk of having acute kidney injury (AKI). This has occurred in patients with severe kidney problems, and the risk is increased with high doses of gadoteridol.

This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Check with your doctor or nurse right away if you or your child have chest pain, cold, clammy skin, confusion, dizziness, lightheadedness, a skin rash, itching, sweating, swelling of the face, tongue, and throat, or trouble breathing after receiving the medicine.

This medicine contains a metal called gadolinium, which can stay in your body (including the brain, bones, skin, kidneys, liver, spleen) for a long time (several months to years). Talk to your doctor if you have concerns.
