# Necitumumab (intravenous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Portrazza

## Description

Necitumumab injection is used in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin to treat squamous non-small cell lung cancer that has spread.

Necitumumab interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by necitumumab, other unwanted effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Some unwanted effects, such as a skin rash, may not be serious but may cause concern. Some of the unwanted effects do not occur until months or years after the medicine is used.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the supervision of your doctor.

## Before Using

### Pediatric

### Geriatric
