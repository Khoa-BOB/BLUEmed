## Description

Mometasone is used to help prevent the symptoms of asthma and improve breathing. When used regularly every day, inhaled mometasone decreases the number and severity of asthma attacks. However, it will not relieve an asthma attack that has already started.

Mometasone HFA is used as a maintenance treatment for the prevention and control of asthma symptoms in patients 5 years of age and older.

Inhaled mometasone belongs to the family of medicines known as corticosteroids (cortisone-like medicines). It works by preventing certain cells in the lungs and breathing passages from releasing substances that cause asthma symptoms.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
