## Description

Inavolisib is used in combination with other medicines (eg, fulvestrant, palbociclib) to treat hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, PIK3CA­mutated, advanced or metastatic (cancer that has spread) breast cancer that has come back after hormonal (endocrine) treatment.
