# Fluorodopa f 18 (intravenous route)

## Description

Fluorodopa F 18 injection is used in adults to help diagnose Parkinsonian syndromes and other cognitive (mental) problems. It is used in a procedure called positron emission tomography (PET) scan to help your doctor see an image of your brain.

Fluorodopa F 18 is a radiopharmaceutical. Radiopharmaceuticals are radioactive agents, which may be used to find and treat certain diseases or to study the function of the body's organs.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor with specialized training in nuclear medicine.

## Before Using

In deciding to use a diagnostic test, any risks of the test must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. Also, other things may affect test results. For this test, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

### Geriatric

### Breastfeeding

There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.

### Drug Interactions

Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.

### Other Interactions

Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.  Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur.  Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.

## Proper Use

A doctor or other trained health professional will give you this medicine. This medicine is given through a needle placed in one of your veins just before you have a PET scan.

Your doctor may want you to take carbidopa at least 1 hour before receiving this medicine. You may need to stop taking any medicines for Parkinson's disease at least 12 hours before receiving this medicine.

Drink enough water to be hydrated before the PET scan.

You will need to urinate right away and as often as possible for 12 hours after the PET scan.

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your progress very closely while you are receiving this medicine. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to receive it.

While receiving this medicine, you will be exposed to radiation. If you have any questions about this, talk to your doctor.

It is important to tell your doctor that you are pregnant or breastfeeding before using this medicine.
