## Description

Ethinyl estradiol and ethynodiol diacetate combination is used to prevent pregnancy. It is a birth control pill that contains two types of hormones, ethinyl estradiol and ethynodiol diacetate, and when taken properly, prevents pregnancy. It works by stopping a woman's egg from fully developing each month. The egg can no longer accept a sperm and fertilization (pregnancy) is prevented.

No contraceptive method is 100 percent effective. Birth control methods such as having surgery to become sterile or not having sex are more effective than birth control pills. Discuss your options for birth control with your doctor.

This medicine does not prevent HIV infection or other sexually transmitted diseases. It will not help as emergency contraception, such as after unprotected sexual contact.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
