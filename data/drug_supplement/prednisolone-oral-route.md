Prednisolone is a corticosteroid (cortisone-like medicine or steroid). It works on the immune system to help relieve swelling, redness, itching, and allergic reactions.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of prednisolone disintegrating tablets and oral liquid in children younger than 2 years of age to treat nephrotic syndrome and in children younger than 1 month of age to treat cancer (eg, aggressive lymphoma and leukemia) . Safety and efficacy have not been established. Because prednisolone may cause slowed growth in children, those who will be using it for a long time should have their weight and growth measured by a doctor regularly.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of prednisolone in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney and bone problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for elderly patients receiving prednisolone.
