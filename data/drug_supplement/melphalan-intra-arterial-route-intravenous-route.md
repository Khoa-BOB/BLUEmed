# Melphalan (intra-arterial route, intravenous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Alkeran IV

Evomela

## Description

Melphalan injection is used to treat multiple myeloma (bone marrow cancer) before receiving a stem cell transplant (conditioning treatment). Melphalan belongs to the group of medicines called alkylating agents (cancer medicines). It works by interfering with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal cells may also be affected by melphalan, other unwanted effects will also occur. Before you begin treatment with melphalan, talk to your doctor about the benefits as well as the risks of using it.

Melphalan injection is also used to treat uveal melanoma (eye cancer) that has spread to the liver and cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable liver metastases).

Evomela® , Alkeran® , and Melphalan injection are to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor. Hepzato® injection is available only under a restricted distribution program called Hepzato® Kit REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) Program.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Solution
- Powder for Solution

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of melphalan injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of melphalan injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution in patients receiving this medicine.

## Proper Use

Evomela® and Alkeran® : A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine in a hospital or cancer treatment center. It is given through a needle placed into one of your veins. This medicine must be given slowly, so the IV tube will need to stay in place for at least 30 minutes. It is usually given for 2 days before receiving a stem cell transplant.

Melphalan injection : A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine in a hospital or cancer treatment center. It is given through a needle placed into one of your veins. This medicine must be given slowly, so the IV tube will need to stay in place for at least 15 to 20 minutes.

Hepzato® : A doctor or other trained health professional will give you this medicine in a hospital. It is given through a needle placed into an artery of the liver every 6 to 8 weeks.

This medicine should come with a patient information leaflet. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure this medicine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

Receiving this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. If you are a woman who can get pregnant, your doctor may do tests to make sure you are not pregnant before receiving this medicine. Use an effective form of birth control while you are receiving this medicine and for at least 6 months after the last dose to keep from getting pregnant. Males who are receiving this medicine, with female partners who can become pregnant, must use effective birth control during and for at least 3 months after the last dose of this medicine. If you think you have become pregnant while receiving the medicine, tell your doctor right away.

This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hives, hoarseness, lightheadedness or fainting, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are receiving this medicine.

This medicine may cause bleeding problems. Check with your doctor right away if you have bleeding gums, coughing up blood, difficulty in breathing or swallowing, dizziness, headache, increased menstrual flow or vaginal bleeding, nosebleeds, paralysis, prolonged bleeding from cuts, red or dark brown urine, or red or black, tarry stools.

Check with your doctor right away if you have pain in the chest, groin, or legs, especially the calves, severe headache, slurred speech, sudden, unexplained trouble breathing, sudden loss of coordination, sudden, severe weakness or numbness in the arm or leg, or vision changes. These may be symptoms of blood clots (eg, thromboembolism).

Melphalan can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:

- If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.
- Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.
- Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.
- Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.
- Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.
- Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.

While you are being treated with melphalan, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccines) without your doctor's approval. Melphalan may lower your body's resistance and the vaccine may not work as well or you might get the infection the vaccine is meant to prevent. In addition, you should not be around other persons living in your household who receive live virus vaccines because there is a chance they could pass the virus on to you. Some examples of live vaccines include measles, mumps, influenza (nasal flu vaccine), poliovirus (oral form), rotavirus, and rubella. Do not get close to them and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you have questions about this, talk to your doctor.

Melphalan can cause diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, or sores or ulcers in the mouth, sometimes even after you receive medicine to prevent these effects. Ask your doctor or nurse about ways to control these symptoms.

Using this medicine may increase your risk of getting other types of cancer (eg, myeloproliferative syndrome, acute leukemia, and carcinoma). Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about this risk.

Tell your doctor right away if you have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.

Some men and women using this medicine have become infertile (unable to have children). This medicine might make a woman stop having menstrual periods temporarily. Talk with your doctor if this is a concern.
