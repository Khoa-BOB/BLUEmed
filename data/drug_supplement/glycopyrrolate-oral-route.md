## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of glycopyrrolate in children 3 to 16 years of age. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 3 years of age.

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of glycopyrrolate in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

### Geriatric

No information is available on whether the risk of glycopyrrolate-induced adverse effects are increased in the elderly. However, it should be used with caution because elderly patients are more likely to have age related liver disease, kidney disease, heart disease, or prostate problems. This may require a dosage adjustment or careful monitoring in elderly patients receiving glycopyrrolate.

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of chlordiazepoxide and clidinium combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects (eg, stomach or bowel problems, trouble urinating, heart rhythm problems, falls, or fractures) of this medicine than younger adults.
