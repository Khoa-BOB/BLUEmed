# Histamine (intradermal route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Histatrol

## Description

Histamine is used to help diagnose problems or disease of the stomach. This test determines how much acid your stomach produces.

How the stomach test is done: Before this medicine is given, the stomach contents are emptied through a tube. Then the dose of histamine, which is based on body weight, is injected under the skin. Five minutes later, the stomach contents are emptied and tested for acidity. This procedure may be repeated several times. An antihistamine medicine may be given before the histamine is injected to prevent a possible unwanted effect.

Histamine is to be used only under the supervision of a doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
