# Macitentan and tadalafil (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Opsynvi

## Description

Macitentan and tadalafil combination is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which is high blood pressure that occurs in the main artery that carries blood from the right side of the heart (the ventricle) to the lungs. When the smaller blood vessels in the lungs become more resistant to blood flow, the right ventricle must work harder to pump enough blood through the lungs. Macitentan and tadalafil combination works by relaxing these blood vessels and increasing the supply of blood to the lungs, which reduces the workload of the heart.

This medicine is only available for female patients under a restricted distribution program called the Macitentan-Containing Products REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program. Male patients do not need to enroll in the REMS program.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
