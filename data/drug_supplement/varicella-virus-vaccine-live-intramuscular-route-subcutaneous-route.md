## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Varivax

### Canadian Brand Name

Varilrix

## Description

Varicella virus live vaccine is an active immunizing agent that is given to protect against infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the virus.

Varicella (commonly known as chickenpox) is an infection that is easily spread from one person to another. Chickenpox is usually a mild infection but sometimes it can cause serious problems, such as pneumonia, inflammation of the brain, and a rare disease called Reye's syndrome.

Immunization against chickenpox is recommended for anyone 12 months of age and older who has not had chickenpox. Immunization against chickenpox is not recommended for infants younger than 12 months of age.

You can be considered to be immune to chickenpox only if you have received 2 doses of the varicella vaccine. You also are considered to be immune if you have a doctor's diagnosis of a previous chickenpox infection or if you have had a blood test showing that you are immune to the varicella virus.

This vaccine is to be administered only by or under the supervision of your doctor or other authorized health care professional.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Powder for Suspension

### Pediatric

## Precautions

It is very important that you or your child return to your doctor’s office at the right time if you or your child needs a second dose of the vaccine . Be sure to notify your doctor of any side effects that may occur after you or your child receive this vaccine.

You should not receive this vaccine if you are using medicine that weakens the immune system (including cancer medicine or steroid medicine).

Do not become pregnant for 3 months after receiving varicella virus vaccine. There is a chance that this vaccine may cause problems during pregnancy. If you think you have become pregnant, tell your doctor right away. Your doctor may want you to join a pregnancy registry for patients receiving this vaccine.

Tell your doctor that you or your child have received this vaccine:

- If you are to receive blood transfusions or other blood products within 5 months of receiving this vaccine.
- If you are to receive any other live virus vaccines within 1 to 3 months after receiving this vaccine.
- If you are to receive varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or other immune globulins within 2 months after receiving this vaccine.

This vaccine may cause a serious allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after you receive the vaccine.

Do not use aspirin or medicines containing aspirin (eg, certain cold medicines) for 6 weeks after receiving this vaccine. Carefully check the label of any pain, headache, or cold medicine you or your child use to be sure it does not contain aspirin or salicylic acid.

You or your child may be able to pass the virus to other people after getting this vaccine. You or your child should avoid close contact with people at high risk for getting chickenpox for 6 weeks after receiving this vaccine. People who are most at risk of catching the virus from you are pregnant women, newborn babies, and people whose bodies cannot fight infection (eg, people with bone marrow disease, AIDS). Talk to your doctor about this risk.
