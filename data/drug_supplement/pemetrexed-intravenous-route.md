## Description

Pemetrexed injection is used in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum-containing chemotherapy as first treatment for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has spread (metastatic) in patients whose tumors do not have an abnormal EGFR or ALK gene. This medicine is also used in combination with cisplatin as first treatment for non-squamous NSCLC that has spread (locally advanced or metastatic).

Pemetrexed injection is also used alone as maintenance treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC that has not progressed after a previous 4-cycle treatment with platinum cancer medicines. It is also used alone to treat recurrent (cancer has come back) or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC in patients who previously received chemotherapy.

Pemetrexed injection is also used together with cisplatin as the first treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma (cancer that affects the inside lining of the lungs and chest wall) that cannot be removed by surgery. Pemetrexed belongs to the group of medicines called antineoplastics. v

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of pemetrexed injection have not been performed in the pediatric population. Safety and effectiveness have not been established.

### Geriatric

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

Receiving this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. If you are female and can get pregnant, your doctor will do tests to make sure you are not pregnant before receiving this medicine. It may also cause birth defects if the father is using it when his sexual partner becomes pregnant. Female patients should use effective birth control during treatment with this medicine and for at least 6 months after the last dose. Male patients who have female partners should use effective birth control during treatment with this medicine and for at least 3 months after the last dose. If you think you have become pregnant while receiving this medicine, tell your doctor right away.

Pemetrexed and cisplatin can sometimes cause nausea and vomiting. However, it is very important that you continue to receive the medicine, even if you begin to feel ill. You can get medicines to help control the nausea and vomiting. Talk with your doctor if you get any of these symptoms.

Pemetrexed can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:

- If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, diarrhea, lower back or side pain, mouth sores, or painful or difficult urination.
- Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.
- Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.
- Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.
- Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.
- Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.

Check with your doctor right away if you have bloody urine, a decrease in frequency or amount of urine, an increase in blood pressure, increased thirst, loss of appetite, lower back or side pain, nausea, swelling of the face, fingers, or lower legs, trouble breathing, unusual tiredness or weakness, vomiting, or weight gain. These could be symptoms of a serious kidney problem.

Serious skin reactions (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) can occur with this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you have blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, red skin lesions, severe acne or a skin rash, sores or ulcers on the skin, or fever or chills with this medicine.

Serious lung or breathing problems (eg, interstitial pneumonitis) may occur after you receive this medicine. Call your doctor right away if have any changes in your breathing after you receive this medicine.

Tell your doctor if you have received radiation treatment in the past. You may be more sensitive to the effects of this medicine (eg, pain and redness of the skin at the place of earlier radiation treatment).

If you have kidney problems, make sure your doctor knows if you are using an NSAID or pain or arthritis medicine, especially ibuprofen. Do not take ibuprofen at least 2 days before or 2 days after receiving this medicine. Taking ibuprofen during treatment with this medicine may increase your risks for bone marrow, kidney, and stomach or bowel problems.

If you plan to have children, talk with your doctor before using this medicine. Some men receiving this medicine have become infertile (unable to have children).

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
