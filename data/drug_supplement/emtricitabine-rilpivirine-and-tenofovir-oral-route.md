## Description

Emtricitabine, rilpivirine, and tenofovir combination is used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This medicine is usually given to patients who have not received any HIV treatment in the past or to replace their current antiviral medicines provided that they meet certain requirements.
