# Cholecystokinin (injection route)

## Description

Cholecystokinin belongs to the group of medicines known as diagnostic aids. Diagnostic aids are used to help diagnose certain medical problems. Cholecystokinin is given by injection before tests are done to see if the gallbladder and pancreas are working the way they should. It is also used to help with other tests of the stomach and intestines.

Cholecystokinin makes the gallbladder contract (squeeze together). It also makes the pancreas produce enzymes, which are some of the juices needed for the digestion of food. In addition, cholecystokinin increases the movements or contractions of the stomach and intestines. The doctor will know if there is anything wrong with these organs if cholecystokinin does not work in the usual way.

The doses of cholecystokinin will be different for different patients and depend on the weight of the patient and on the type of test.

Cholecystokinin is used only under the supervision of a doctor.

## Before Using

In deciding to use a diagnostic test, any risks of the test must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. Also, other things may affect test results. For this test, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Studies on this medicine have been done only in adult patients, and there is no specific information comparing use of cholecystokinin in children with use in other age groups.

### Geriatric

This medicine has been tested and has not been shown to cause different side effects or problems in older people than it does in younger adults.

### Drug Interactions

Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.

### Other Interactions

Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.  Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur.  Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.
