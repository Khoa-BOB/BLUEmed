## Proper Use

Use this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor. Do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may increase the chance of side effects.

Shake the regular eye drops well just before each use. If you are using the gel-forming eye drops , turn the bottle upside down and shake it once. You do not need to shake the gel-forming eye drops more than once.

To use the eye drops (solution and gel):

- First, wash your hands. Tilt the head back and, pressing your finger gently on the skin just beneath the lower eyelid, pull the lower eyelid away from the eye to make a space. Drop the medicine into this space. Let go of the eyelid and gently close the eyes. Do not blink. Keep the eyes closed and apply pressure to the inner corner of the eye with your finger for 1 or 2 minutes to allow the medicine to be absorbed by the eye.
- Immediately after using the medicine, wash your hands to remove any medicine that may be on them.
- To keep the medicine as germ-free as possible, do not touch the applicator tip to any surface (including the eye). Also, keep the container tightly closed. Serious damage to the eye and possible loss of vision may result from using contaminated eye medicines.

If your doctor ordered two different eye medicines to be used together, wait at least 10 minutes after the regular eye drops before using the second medicine. This will help prevent the second medicine from “washing out” the first one. The gel-forming eye drops should always be the last medicine used if two medicines are ordered. Wait 10 minutes before using the gel-forming eye drops.

You should not use the regular eye drops if you have contact lenses in your eyes. Remove your contact lenses before you use this medicine. Wait at least 15 minutes after you use the medicine before putting the contact lenses back in.
