# Paricalcitol (intravenous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Zemplar

## Description

Paricalcitol injection is used to treat and prevent hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease who are on dialysis. Hyperparathyroidism is a condition that is caused when the parathyroid glands located in the neck make too much parathyroid hormone (PTH). This hormone controls the concentrations of calcium and phosphorus in your blood. Paricalcitol helps lower the amount of PTH which lowers the calcium and phosphorus concentrations.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
