If you are taking itraconazole, do not receive rifampin 2 weeks before and during itraconazole treatment.

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress while you are receiving this medicine . Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

You should not receive this medicine if you or your child are also using lurasidone (Latuda®) or certain medicines to treat HIV infection (eg, atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, ritonavir, ritonavir-boosted saquinavir, saquinavir, tipranavir, Aptivus®, Fortovase®, Invirase®, Lexiva®, Norvir®, Prezista®, or Reyataz®).

Do not receive this medicine together with praziquantel. If you need to take praziquantel, you should stop receiving rifampin 4 weeks before starting praziquantel. You may restart rifampin one day after the last dose of praziquantel.

Liver problems may be more likely to occur if you drink alcoholic beverages regularly while you are receiving this medicine. Also, the regular use of alcohol may keep this medicine from working properly. Therefore, you should strictly limit the amount of alcoholic beverages you drink while you are receiving this medicine.

Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, unusual tiredness or weakness, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.

Serious skin reactions (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis) can occur with this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, red skin lesions, severe acne or a skin rash, sores or ulcers on the skin, or fever or chills with this medicine.

Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have fever, chills, cough, sore throat, swollen, painful, or tender lymph glands in the neck, armpit, or groin, or yellow skin or eyes while receiving this medicine. These could be symptoms of a serious condition called drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS).

Tell your doctor right away if you have chest pain, cough, coughing or spitting up blood, difficulty in breathing, sore throat, muscle aches, night sweats, sudden high fever, or unusual tiredness. These could be symptoms of a paradoxical drug reaction to this medicine. If your symptoms do not improve within a few days or if they become worse, check with your doctor.

This medicine may cause severe tenderness and pain at the place where the injection was given. Contact your doctor right away if you or your child notice any bleeding, blistering, burning, coldness, discoloration of the skin, feeling of pressure, hives, infection, inflammation, itching, lumps, numbness, pain, rash, redness, scarring, soreness, stinging, swelling, tenderness, tingling, ulceration, or warmth at the injection site.

Rifampin will cause urine, saliva, sputum, sweat, teeth, and tears to turn a reddish-orange to reddish-brown color. This is to be expected while you are receiving this medicine.

This condition will return to normal once you stop receiving this medicine. If you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.

If you or your child develop a skin rash, hives, or any allergic reaction to this medicine, check with your doctor right away.
