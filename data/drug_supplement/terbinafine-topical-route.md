## Precautions

Discontinue using this medicine and check with your doctor if increased irritation or possible sensitization (redness, itching, burning, blistering, swelling, or oozing) occurs while using the medication.

If your skin problem does not improve within 4 to 7 weeks, or if it becomes worse, check with your doctor.

To help clear up your infection completely and to help make sure it does not return, good health habits are also needed. The following measures will help reduce chafing and irritation and will also help keep the area cool and dry.

- For patients using terbinafine for ringworm of the body: Carefully dry yourself after bathing. Avoid too much heat and humidity if possible. Try to keep moisture from building up on affected areas of the body. Wear well-ventilated, loose-fitting clothing. Use a bland, absorbent powder (for example, talcum powder) once or twice a day. Be sure to use the powder after terbinafine cream or solution has been applied and has disappeared into the skin.
- For patients using terbinafine for ringworm of the groin: Avoid wearing underwear that is tight-fitting or made from synthetic (man-made) materials (for example, rayon or nylon). Instead, wear loose-fitting, cotton underwear. Use a bland, absorbent powder (for example, talcum powder) on the skin. It is best to use the powder between the times you use terbinafine.
- For patients using terbinafine for ringworm of the foot: Carefully dry the feet, especially between the toes, after bathing. Avoid wearing socks made from wool or synthetic materials (for example, rayon or nylon). Instead, wear clean, cotton socks and change them daily or more often if the feet sweat a lot. Wear sandals or well-ventilated shoes (for example, shoes with holes). Use a bland, absorbent powder (for example, talcum powder) between the toes, on the feet, and in socks and shoes once or twice a day. It is best to use the powder between the times you use terbinafine.
