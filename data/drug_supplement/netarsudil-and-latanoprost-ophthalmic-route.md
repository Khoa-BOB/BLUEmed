## Precautions

It is very important that your eye doctor (ophthalmologist) check your progress at regular visits to make sure this medicine is working properly and to check for unwanted effects.

This medicine may cause other eye problems (eg, epithelial corneal edema, macular edema). Check with your doctor right way if you have changes in vision or pain, itching, redness, swelling, or other signs of eye or eyelid irritation.

This medicine contains latanoprost, which can cause the iris (colored part) of your treated eye to become more brown in color. This is more likely to happen if you have blue-brown, gray-brown, green-brown, or yellow-brown eyes. You may notice this change usually within several months or years from the start of treatment. You may also have darkening of the eyelid skin color or longer, thicker, and darker eyelashes. These changes to the iris, eyelid, and eyelashes may be permanent even if you stop using this medicine. However, any of these changes will affect only the eye being treated. Check with your doctor if you have any concerns about this.
