This medicine is to be used only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor.

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress while you are receiving this medicine and during the MRI scan to make sure this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

This medicine should not be given intrathecally (injection given through the spinal canal). It may cause serious unwanted effects including agitation, back pain, blurred vision, vomiting, unusual tiredness or weakness, dizziness, drowsiness, fever, headache, irritability, mood or mental changes, hallucinations, stiff neck, confusion, change or loss of consciousness, seizures, or death.

These may be symptoms of a very serious disease called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF).

This medicine may increase your risk of having acute kidney injury (AKI). This has occurred in patients with severe kidney problems, and the risk is increased with high doses of gadoxetate.
