# Gadobutrol (intravenous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Gadavist

## Description

Gadobutrol injection is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent that is used to help create a clear picture of the body during an MRI scan. MRI scans are a special kind of procedure that lets a doctor look at the inside of the body, such as the brain. They use magnets and computers to create images or “pictures” of the body. Unlike x-rays, MRI scans do not involve radiation. Gadobutrol is a gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) that is given by injection before the MRI to help diagnose problems in the brain, spine, breast, and other parts of your body.

Gadobutrol injection is also used for magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to evaluate known or suspected supra-aortic or renal artery disease in adults and children. It is also used to  assess how well blood flows through your heart (myocardial perfusion) and late gadolinium enhancement in adult patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Solution

## Proper Use

A doctor or other trained health professional will give you or your child this medicine in a medical facility. It is given through an IV catheter that is placed into one of your veins just before you have an MRI or MRA scan.

This medicine comes with a Medication Guide. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress while you are receiving this medicine and during the MRI or MRA scan to make sure this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

This medicine should not be given intrathecally (injection given through the spinal canal). It may cause serious unwanted effects including agitation, back pain, blurred vision, change or loss of consciousness, confusion, death, dizziness, drowsiness, fever, hallucinations, headache, irritability, mood or mental changes, seizures, stiff neck, unusual tiredness or weakness, or vomiting when given intrathecally.

Check with your doctor or nurse right away if you or your child have burning or itching of the skin, deep bone pain in the hips or ribs, joint stiffness, a limited range of motion in the arms and legs, muscle weakness, red or dark patches on the skin of the arms or legs, or skin swelling, hardening, or tightening within the first few days or weeks after you receive this medicine. These may be symptoms of a very serious disease called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF).

This medicine may cause a serious allergic reaction called anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Check with your doctor or nurse right away if you or your child have chest pain, cold, clammy skin, confusion, dizziness, lightheadedness, a skin rash, itching, sweating, swelling of the face, tongue, and throat, or trouble with breathing after receiving the medicine.

Check with your doctor right away if you develop a fever, chest pain or tightness, fast breathing, or trouble breathing. These could be symptoms of a serious lung condition called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

This medicine contains a metal called gadolinium, which can stay in your body (including the brain, bones, skin, liver, kidney, spleen) for a long time (several months to years). Talk to your doctor if you have concerns.

This medicine may increase your risk of having acute kidney injury (AKI). This has occurred in patients with severe kidney problems, and the risk is increased if you or your child are receiving high doses of gadobutrol.

Tell your doctor right away if you or your child have burning pain, feeling of warmth or coldness, redness or swelling at the injection site.
