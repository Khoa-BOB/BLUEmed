# Buprenorphine (injection route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Buprenex

## Description

Buprenorphine injection is used to relieve moderate to severe pain. It is also used in patients who have received treatment with an oral form of buprenorphine that is placed under the tongue or inside the cheek for 7 days, followed by an adjustment in the dose for at least 7 days or who are already being treated with buprenorphine.

Buprenorphine belongs to the group of medicines called narcotic analgesics (pain medicines). It acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain.

When a narcotic medicine is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely.

Buprenorphine injection and Buprenex® are available only with your doctor's prescription. Brixadi™ and Sublocade® injection is available only under a restricted distribution program called Brixadi™ REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) Program and Sublocade® REMS Program.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
