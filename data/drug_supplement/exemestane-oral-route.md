# Exemestane (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Aromasin

## Description

Exemestane is used to treat early and advanced breast cancer in women who have already stopped menstruating (postmenopausal). It is usually used in women who have already received a cancer medication called tamoxifen.

Many breast cancer tumors grow in response to estrogen. Exemestane interferes with the production of estrogen in the body. As a result, the amount of estrogen that the tumor is exposed to is reduced, which will limit the growth of the tumor.

Before you begin treatment with exemestane, you and your doctor should talk about the benefits this medicine will do as well as the risks of using it.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
