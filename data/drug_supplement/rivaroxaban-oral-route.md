# Rivaroxaban (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Xarelto

## Description

Rivaroxaban is used to treat and prevent deep venous thrombosis (DVT), a condition in which harmful blood clots form in the blood vessels of the legs. These blood clots can travel to the lungs and can become lodged in the blood vessels of the lungs, causing a condition called pulmonary embolism (PE). This medicine is used for several days after hip or knee replacement surgery while you are unable to walk. It is during this time that blood clots are most likely to form. It also reduces the risk of blood clots occurring again in patients who are still at risk for DVT or PE after receiving treatment for at least 6 months.

Rivaroxaban is also used to prevent stroke and blood clots in patients with certain heart rhythm problems (eg, nonvalvular atrial fibrillation). It is also used together with aspirin to decrease the risk of serious heart problems, heart attack, and stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (a condition where the blood supply to the heart is reduced or blocked). This medicine is also used together with aspirin to lower the risk of sudden decrease in blood flow to the legs, major amputation, heart attack, or stroke in patients with peripheral artery disease (a condition where the blood flow to the legs is reduced), including patients who have had a recent surgery to improve blood flow to the legs. This medicine is also used to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE) in certain patients that are hospitalized for an acute illness and after discharge who are at risk of getting blood clots because of decreased ability to move around (mobility) and who do not have a high risk of bleeding. It is also used to treat or reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after receiving at least 5 days of medicine to treat blood clots and helps prevent blood clots in patients with congenital heart disease after undergoing the Fontan procedure.

Rivaroxaban is a factor Xa inhibitor, an anticoagulant. It works by decreasing the clotting ability of the blood and helps prevent harmful clots from forming in the blood vessels.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet

For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of rivaroxaban to treat and prevent venous thromboembolism in children and to prevent blood clots in children 2 years of age with congenital heart disease . Safety and efficacy have been established. Use is not recommended in children younger than 6 months of age who were less than 37 weeks of growth at birth, had less than 10 days of oral feeding, or weighing less than 2.6 kilograms (kg).

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of rivaroxaban in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have bleeding and blood clotting problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving rivaroxaban.
