## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Jentadueto

Jentadueto XR

## Description

Linagliptin and metformin combination is used to treat high blood sugar levels caused by type 2 diabetes. Linagliptin helps to control blood sugar levels by increasing substances in the body that make the pancreas release more insulin. It also signals the liver to stop producing sugar (glucose) when there is too much sugar in the blood. Metformin reduces the absorption of sugar from the stomach, reduces the release of stored sugar from the liver, and helps your body use sugar better. This medicine does not help patients who have insulin-dependent or type 1 diabetes.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
- Tablet, Extended Release
