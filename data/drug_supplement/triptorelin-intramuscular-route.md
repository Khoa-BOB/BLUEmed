Triptorelin is used to treat advanced prostate cancer. It is a hormone that is similar to the one normally released from the hypothalamus gland in the brain. When given on a regular basis to men, triptorelin decreases testosterone levels which helps treat prostate cancer.

Triptorelin is also used to treat central precocious puberty (CPP), a condition which causes early puberty in boys (before 9 years of age) and girls (before 8 years of age).

This medicine is to be given only by or under the supervision of a doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
