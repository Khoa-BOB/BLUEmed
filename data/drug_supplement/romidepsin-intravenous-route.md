### US Brand Name

Istodax

## Description

Romidepsin injection is used to treat a certain type of cancer of the white blood cells called cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in patients who have received at least 1 previous treatment.

Romidepsin interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected, other unwanted effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Before you begin treatment with romidepsin, you and your doctor should talk about the benefits of this medicine as well as the risks of receiving it.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.
- Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.
- Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.
- Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.
