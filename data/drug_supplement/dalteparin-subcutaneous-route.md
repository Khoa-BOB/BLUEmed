# Dalteparin (subcutaneous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Fragmin

## Description

Dalteparin is used to prevent deep venous thrombosis, a condition in which harmful blood clots form in the blood vessels of the legs. These blood clots can travel to the lungs and can become lodged in the blood vessels of the lungs, causing a condition called pulmonary embolism. This medicine is also used together with aspirin to prevent blood clots from forming in blood vessels of patients with unstable angina or heart attack. Dalteparin is also used for several days after abdominal surgery, hip replacement surgery, or while you are unable to walk. It is during this time that blood clots are most likely to form. Dalteparin is also used to treat symptomatic blood clots (eg, pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis) in children and as extended treatment of symptomatic blood clots in adults with cancer.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
