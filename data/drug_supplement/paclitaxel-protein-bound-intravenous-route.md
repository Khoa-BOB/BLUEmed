# Paclitaxel protein-bound (intravenous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Abraxane

### Canadian Brand Name

PACLitaxel

## Description

Paclitaxel protein-bound injection is used to treat metastatic breast cancer (cancer that has already spread) after other treatments have failed. It is used together with carboplatin, a cancer medicine, to treat advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in patients who cannot receive radiation therapy or have surgery. Paclitaxel protein-bound is used together with gemcitabine, a cancer medicine, to treat metastatic pancreas cancer.

Paclitaxel belongs to the group of medicines called antineoplastics (cancer medicines). It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by paclitaxel, other unwanted effects will also occur.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Powder for Suspension

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure this medicine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

Using this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Use an effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant. If you think you have become pregnant while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away.

Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are receiving this medicine.

Paclitaxel can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, which will increase the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets in your blood, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, these are the precautions you can take to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:

- If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection, or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or have painful or difficult urination.
- Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in your urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.
- Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.
- Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.
- Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects, such as a safety razor, fingernail clippers, or toenail clippers.
- Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.

This medicine is made from donated human blood. Although the risk is low, some people have received viruses from human blood products. Human donors and donated blood are both tested for viruses before the medicine is prepared. Talk with your doctor if this concerns you.

Check with your doctor right away if you have burning, numbness, tingling, or painful sensations in the arms, hands, legs, or feet. These could be symptoms of a condition called sensory neuropathy.

Lung or breathing problems may occur if you are receiving this medicine together with gemcitabine. Tell your doctor right away if you have shortness of breath, trouble breathing, or a persistent dry cough.
