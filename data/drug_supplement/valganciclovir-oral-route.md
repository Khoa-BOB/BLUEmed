# Valganciclovir (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Valcyte

## Description

Valganciclovir is used to treat symptoms of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, an infection in the eyes of people with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Valganciclovir will not cure this eye infection, but it may help to keep the symptoms from becoming worse.

Valganciclovir is an antiviral. It is used to treat infections caused by viruses. This medicine is also used to prevent CMV disease in patients who have received an organ transplant (eg, heart, kidney, or kidney-pancreas transplant).

This medicine may cause some serious side effects, including anemia and other blood problems. Before you begin treatment with valganciclovir, you and your doctor should talk about the benefit this medicine will do as well as the risks of using it.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
- Powder for Solution

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of valganciclovir for the prevention of CMV disease in kidney and heart transplant children. However, safety and efficacy of valganciclovir for the prevention of CMV disease have not been established in liver transplant children, in kidney transplant children younger than 4 months of age, and in heart transplant children younger than 1 month of age.

### Geriatric

Although appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of valganciclovir have not been performed in the geriatric population, no geriatric-specific problems have been documented to date. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving valganciclovir.

### Breastfeeding

There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.

If you are using the oral liquid , use the oral dispenser that comes with the package to measure each dose accurately. The average household teaspoon may not hold the right amount of liquid.

If you are taking ganciclovir (Cytovene®) capsules before switching to valganciclovir (Valcyte®) tablets, the dose of your medicine may change.
