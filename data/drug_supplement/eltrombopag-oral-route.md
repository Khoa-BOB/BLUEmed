# Eltrombopag (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Alvaiz

Promacta

## Description

Eltrombopag is used to treat thrombocytopenia (low platelets in the blood) in patients with a blood disorder called chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). This medicine is used after a splenectomy (surgery to remove the spleen) and other medicines (eg, steroids or immunoglobulin) have not worked well enough. Eltrombopag is also used to treat thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic hepatitis C, along with interferon treatment. Platelets help clot the blood, so a person with thrombocytopenia may have bleeding problems. Eltrombopag works by stimulating the bone marrow to produce more platelets.

Eltrombopag is used together with standard immunosuppressive treatment for the first-line treatment of severe aplastic anemia (SAA) in adults and children 2 years of age and older. It is also used to treat SAA in patients who have received other medicines that did not work well.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
- Powder for Suspension

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Geriatric
