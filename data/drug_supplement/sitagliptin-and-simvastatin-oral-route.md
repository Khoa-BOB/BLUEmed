# Sitagliptin and simvastatin (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Juvisync

## Description

Sitagliptin and simvastatin combination is used together with a proper diet and exercise to treat type 2 diabetes. It is also used together with a proper diet to treat high cholesterol and triglyceride (fats) levels in the blood. This medicine may help prevent medical problems caused by clogged blood vessels such as heart attacks and strokes.

Sitagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor. It helps to control blood sugar levels by increasing substances in the body that make the pancreas release more insulin. It also signals the liver to stop producing sugar (glucose) when there is too much sugar in the blood.

Simvastatin belongs to the group of medicines called statins. It works to reduce the amount of cholesterol in the blood by blocking the production of cholesterol.

This medicine was available only with your doctor's prescription.  The Juvisync™ product will no longer be marketed in the United States as of September 26, 2013, but may be available in other countries.

## Before Using

### Pediatric

Myopathy is more common when high doses of simvastatin (eg, 80 milligrams) are used, but some people get myopathy with lower doses.

Call your doctor right away if you have dark-colored urine, diarrhea, a fever, muscle cramps or spasms, muscle pain or stiffness, or unusual tiredness or weakness. These could be symptoms of a serious muscle problem called rhabdomyolysis, which can cause kidney problems.

Glucagon is a medicine that is used in emergency situations when severe symptoms, such as seizures (convulsions) or unconsciousness occur. Have a glucagon kit available, along with a syringe and needle, and know how to use it. The members of your family should also know how to use glucagon.

There may be a time when you need emergency help for a problem caused by your diabetes. You need to be prepared for these emergencies. It is a good idea to wear a medical identification (ID) bracelet or neck chain at all times. Also, carry an ID card in your wallet or purse that says you have diabetes with a list of all your medicines.

Make sure any doctor or dentist who treats you knows that you are using this medicine. You may need to stop using this medicine if you have major surgery, a major injury, or you develop other serious health problems.
