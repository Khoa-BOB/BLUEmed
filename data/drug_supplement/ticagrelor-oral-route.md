# Ticagrelor (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Brilinta

## Description

Ticagrelor is used alone or together with aspirin to lessen the chance of heart attack or stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of heart attack. Acute coronary syndrome is a condition where the blood flow to the heart is blocked. It is also used to reduce the risk of blood clots in patients who have received stents to treat ACS.

Ticagrelor is also used alone or together with aspirin to lessen the chance of first heart attack or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) who are at risk for having a heart attack or stroke. Coronary artery disease is a condition where the blood flow to the heart is decreased.

Ticagrelor is also used alone or together with aspirin to lessen the chance of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA). Transient ischemic attack or mini-stroke is a condition where the blood supply to the brain is shortly blocked and lasts for a few minutes.

A heart attack or stroke may occur when a blood vessel in the heart or brain is blocked by a blood clot. Ticagrelor reduces the chance that a harmful blood clot will form by preventing certain cells in the blood from clumping together. This effect of ticagrelor may also increase the chance of serious bleeding in some people.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
