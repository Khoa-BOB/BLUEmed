# Torsemide (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Demadex

Soaanz

## Description

Torsemide is used to help treat fluid retention (edema) and swelling that is caused by congestive heart failure, liver disease, kidney disease. It belongs to the group of medicines called loop diuretics (water pills). This medicine works by acting on the kidneys to increase the flow of urine.

Torsemide is also used alone or together with other medicines to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet

## Before Using
