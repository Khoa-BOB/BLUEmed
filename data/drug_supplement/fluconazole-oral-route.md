Fluconazole is used to treat serious fungal or yeast infections, including vaginal candidiasis, oropharyngeal candidiasis (thrush, oral thrush), esophageal candidiasis (candida esophagitis), other candida infections (including urinary tract infections, peritonitis [inflammation of the lining of the stomach], and infections that may occur in different parts of the body), or fungal (cryptococcal) meningitis.

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of fluconazole for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis in children 6 months to 13 years of age, for the treatment of esophageal candidiasis, other candida infections, or fungal (cryptococcal) meningitis in children, and for children on ECMO . Safety and efficacy have been established.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of fluconazole in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving fluconazole.
