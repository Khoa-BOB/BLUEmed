Apixaban is a factor Xa inhibitor, an anticoagulant. It works by decreasing the clotting ability of the blood and helps preventing harmful clots from forming in the blood vessels.

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to take it. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

Make sure your doctor knows if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant during treatment with this medicine.

Make sure any doctor who treats you knows that you are using this medicine. You may need to stop using this medicine for several days before having surgery, including dental procedures.

Do not suddenly stop using this medicine without asking your doctor . You might have a higher risk of stroke after you stop using this medicine.

You may bleed and bruise more easily while you are using this medicine. Be extra careful to avoid injuries. Stay away from rough sports or other situations where you could be bruised, cut, or injured. Gently brush and floss your teeth. Be careful when using sharp objects, including razors and fingernail clippers. Avoid picking your nose. If you need to blow your nose, blow it gently.

This medicine may cause bleeding problems. This risk is higher if you have a catheter in your back for pain medicine or anesthesia (called an epidural), or if you have kidney problems. The risk of bleeding increases if your kidney problems get worse. Check with your doctor right away if you have any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, bleeding gums, blood in the urine or stools, tingling, numbness, or weakness of the lower legs, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.

This medicine may increase the risk of forming blood clots in the spine or epidural area, which may lead to long-term or permanent paralysis. This is more likely to occur if you have an epidural catheter placed in your back, are taking NSAID or blood clotting medicine, a history of repeated epidural punctures or problems with your spine, or have had surgery on your spine. Tell your doctor right away if you have back pain, loss of bladder or bowel control, tingling, numbness, or muscle weakness, especially in your legs and feet.
