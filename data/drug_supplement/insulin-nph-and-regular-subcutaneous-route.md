## Description

Insulin human isophane and insulin human regular is a combination of an intermediate-acting type insulin and a short-acting type of insulin. Insulin is one of many hormones that help the body turn the food we eat into energy. This is done by using the glucose (sugar) in the blood as quick energy. Also, insulin helps us store energy that we can use later. When you have diabetes mellitus, your body cannot make enough insulin or does not use insulin properly. This causes you to have too much sugar in your blood. Like other types of insulin, insulin human isophane and insulin human regular combination is used to keep your blood sugar level close to normal.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
