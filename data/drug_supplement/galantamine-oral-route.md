## Description

Galantamine is used to treat mild to moderate dementia (memory loss and mental changes) that is a sign of Alzheimer's disease. Galantamine will not cure Alzheimer's disease, and it will not stop the disease from getting worse. However, galantamine can improve the thinking ability in some patients with Alzheimer's disease.

In Alzheimer's disease, many chemical changes take place in the brain. One of the earliest and biggest changes is that there is less of a chemical called acetylcholine (ACh). ACh helps the brain to work properly. Galantamine slows the breakdown of ACh, so it can build up and have a greater effect. However, as Alzheimer's disease gets worse, there will be less and less ACh, so galantamine may not work as well.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Solution
- Capsule, Extended Release
- Tablet
