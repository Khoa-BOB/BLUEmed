## Description

Tretinoin is used to treat acne vulgaris or other skin diseases as determined by your doctor. It works partly by keeping skin pores clear.

One of the tretinoin creams is used to treat fine wrinkles, dark spots, or rough skin on the face caused by the damaging rays of the sun. It works by lightening the skin, replacing older skin with newer skin, and slowing down the way the body removes skin cells that may have been harmed by the sun. Tretinoin works best when used within a skin care program that includes protecting the treated skin from the sun. However, it does not completely or permanently erase these skin problems or greatly improve more obvious changes in the skin, such as deep wrinkles caused by the sun or the natural aging process.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Gel/Jelly
- Cream
- Lotion

## Proper Use

It is very important that you use this medicine only as directed . Do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may cause your skin to be irritated. You may need to use this medicine for several weeks or months before your skin starts to look better. Applying extra medicine will not make it work faster.

This medicine should come with a patient information leaflet. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.

This medicine is for use on the skin only . Do not get it in your eyes, nose, corners of your nose, lips, mouth, or vagina. Do not use on skin areas that have cuts, scrapes, or sunburn. If it does get on these areas, rinse it off right away.

Before applying tretinoin, wash the skin with a mild soap or cleanser and warm water by using the tips of your fingers. Then gently pat dry. Do not scrub your face with a sponge or washcloth. Wait 20 to 30 minutes before applying this medicine to make sure the skin is completely dry. Applying tretinoin to wet skin can irritate it.

To use the liquid form of this medicine:

- Using your fingertips, gauze pad, or cotton swab, apply enough tretinoin solution to cover the affected areas. If you use a gauze pad or a cotton swab for applying the medicine, avoid getting it too wet. This will help prevent the medicine from running into areas not intended for treatment.

After applying the medicine, wash your hands to remove any medicine that might remain on them.

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly and to check for unwanted effects.

During the first 3 weeks you are using tretinoin, your skin may become irritated. Also, your acne may seem to get worse before it gets better. It may take longer than 12 weeks before you notice full improvement of your acne, even if you use the medicine every day. For Retin-A Micro® gel , you may notice improvement after 2 weeks, but more than 7 weeks of treatment may be needed. Check with your doctor if skin irritation becomes severe or if your acne does not improve within 8 to 12 weeks.

You should avoid washing the skin treated with tretinoin too often or scrubbing it hard when washing.

Avoid using any topical medicine on the same area within 1 hour before or after using tretinoin. Otherwise, tretinoin may not work properly or skin irritation might occur.

Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, it is especially important to avoid using the following skin products on the same area as tretinoin:

- Any other topical acne product or skin product containing a peeling agent (eg, benzoyl peroxide, resorcinol, salicylic acid, or sulfur).
- Hair products that are irritating, such as permanents or hair removal products.
- Skin products that cause sensitivity to the sun, including those containing spices or limes.
- Skin products containing a large amount of alcohol (eg, astringents, shaving creams, or after-shave lotions).
- Skin products that are too drying or abrasive, such as some cosmetics, soaps, or skin cleansers.

Serious skin reactions including pain, irritation, itching, burning, redness, peeling, dryness, scaling, or stinging of the skin can occur during treatment with this medicine. Your doctor may tell you to use a moisturizer to treat skin irritation.

During the first 6 months of use, avoid overexposing the treated areas to sunlight, wind, or cold weather. The skin will be more prone to sunburn, dryness, or irritation, especially during the first 2 or 3 weeks. However, you should not stop using this medicine unless the skin irritation becomes too severe. Do not use a sunlamp.

This medicine may make your skin more sensitive to sunlight. Use a sunscreen and wear loose-fitting clothes when you are outdoors. Avoid sunlamps and tanning beds.

Check with your doctor at any time your skin becomes too dry and irritated. Your doctor can help you choose the right skin products for you to reduce skin dryness and irritation and may include the following:

- For patients using tretinoin for the treatment of acne: Regular use of water-based creams or lotions helps to reduce skin irritation or dryness that may be caused by the use of tretinoin.
- For patients using tretinoin for the treatment of fine wrinkling, dark spots, and rough skin caused by the sun: This medicine should be used as part of an ongoing program to avoid further damage to your skin from the sun. This program includes staying out of the sun when possible or wearing proper clothing or hats to protect your skin from sunlight. Regular use of oil-based creams or lotions helps to reduce skin irritation or dryness caused by the use of tretinoin.
