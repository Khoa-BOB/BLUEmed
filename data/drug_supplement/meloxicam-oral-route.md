### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of meloxicam oral liquid or tablets to treat juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in children 2 years of age and older or meloxicam disintegrating tablets in children 2 years of age and older weighing 60 kilograms (kg) or more.

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of meloxicam capsules in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

### Geriatric
