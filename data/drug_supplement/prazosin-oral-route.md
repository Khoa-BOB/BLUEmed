# Prazosin (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Minipress

## Description

Prazosin is used alone or together with other medicines to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled.

Prazosin belongs to a class of medicines called antihypertensives. It works by relaxing the blood vessels so that blood passes through them more easily. This helps to lower blood pressure. Prazosin may also be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
