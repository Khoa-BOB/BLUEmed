If you think you have become pregnant while using this medicine, tell your doctor right away.

Avoid being near people who are sick or have infections while you are using this medicine. Wash your hands often. Also tell your doctor if you have ever had an infection that would not go away or an infection that kept coming back.

Siponimod may cause a rare condition called immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). This may occur after a person stops receiving this medicine after developing PML during treatment. Tell your doctor right away if you have an inflammatory reaction to an infection that includes mild burning, stinging, or tingling of the skin, or a feeling of heat, redness, or swelling of the skin.

Check with your doctor right away if blurred vision, difficulty with reading, or any other change in vision occurs during or after treatment. Your doctor may want your eyes be checked by an ophthalmologist (eye doctor).

This medicine may cause heart rhythm problems. Tell your doctor right away if you get dizzy or lightheaded, have a fast, slow, or irregular heartbeat, or feel like fainting.

Tell your doctor right away if you have a cough, trouble breathing, chest tightness, or any type of breathing problem with this medicine. These could be symptoms of a serious lung problem.

Check with your doctor right away if you have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.

While you are being treated with siponimod, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccinations) without your doctor's approval. You should not receive a live vaccine during treatment with this medicine and for 4 weeks after the last dose. Do not use this medicine 1 week before and for 4 weeks after receiving a live vaccine. Siponimod may lower your body's resistance and there is a chance you might get the infection the immunization is meant to prevent.

Also, avoid persons who have taken oral polio vaccine within the last several months. Do not get close to them, and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you cannot take these precautions, you should consider wearing a protective face mask that covers the nose and mouth.
