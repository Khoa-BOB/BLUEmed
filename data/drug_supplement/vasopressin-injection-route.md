# Vasopressin (injection route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Pitressin

## Description

Vasopressin injection is used to control the frequent urination, increased thirst, and loss of water caused by diabetes insipidus. This is a condition that causes the body to lose too much water and become dehydrated. Vasopressin injection is also used to prevent and treat abdominal or stomach distension that occurs after surgery. It is also used in abdominal or stomach roentgenography.

Vasopressin injection is also used to increase blood pressure in adults with vasodilatory shock (eg, post-cardiotomy, sepsis) who remain to have low blood pressure after receiving fluids and medicines.

Vasopressin is a hormone that is produced in the body. It acts on the kidneys to reduce the flow of urine.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
