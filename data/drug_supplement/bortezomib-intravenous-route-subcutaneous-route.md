# Bortezomib (intravenous route, subcutaneous route)

## Description

Bortezomib injection is used to treat multiple myeloma (blood plasma cell cancer) in patients with or without a previous history of treatment, and mantle cell lymphoma.

Bortezomib is an antineoplastic agent (cancer medicine). It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by bortezomib, other effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Other effects, such as a skin rash, may not be serious but may cause concern. Some effects may not occur until months or years after the medicine is used.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine in a medical facility. It is given through a needle placed into one of your veins or as a shot under your skin (usually in the abdomen or thighs).

You may receive medicines to help prevent nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Drink extra fluids while you are using this medicine to keep from getting dehydrated. This could also help you avoid feeling dizzy or lightheaded. You may also receive medicines (eg, dexamethasone, melphalan, prednisone, antivirals) to help prevent unwanted reactions to the injection and decrease the risk of virus infection (eg, herpes zoster) reactivation.

If you are using this medicine for multiple myeloma , it is important to tell your doctor if you have received bortezomib in the past.

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

Female patients should use effective birth control during treatment with this medicine and for at least 7 months after the last dose.

Bortezomib can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:

- If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.
- Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.
- Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.
- Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.
- Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects, such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.
- Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.

This medicine may cause a serious reaction, called tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Call your doctor right away if you have a change in how much or how often you urinate, muscle or joint pain, stiffness or swelling, lower back, side, or stomach pain, a rapid weight gain, swelling of the feet or lower legs, or unusual tiredness or weakness.

Check with your doctor right away if you have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.
