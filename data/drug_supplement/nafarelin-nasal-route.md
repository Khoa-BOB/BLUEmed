# Nafarelin (nasal route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Synarel

## Description

Nafarelin nasal spray is a synthetic (man-made) hormone that is similar to a natural hormone that is produced in the brain. It is used for the treatment of:

- Central precocious puberty (CPP), a condition which causes early puberty in boys (before 9 years of age) and in girls (before 8 years of age), or
- Endometriosis, a painful condition caused by extra tissue growing inside or outside of the uterus (womb).

When given regularly to boys and girls experiencing early puberty, nafarelin slows down the development of genital areas in both sexes. It will also slow breast development in girls. This medicine will delay puberty as long as the child continues to use it.

When given regularly to women, nafarelin decreases estrogen levels which helps treat endometriosis. It prevents the growth of tissue caused by endometriosis in adult women during treatment and for 6 months after treatment is discontinued.

Suppressing estrogen can cause thinning of the bones or slowing of growth. This is a problem for adult women whose bones are no longer growing. Slowing the growth of bones is a positive effect for girls and boys whose bones grow too fast when puberty begins too early. Boys and girls may benefit by adding inches to their adult height when nafarelin causes their bones to grow at the proper and expected rate for children.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Spray

This medicine comes with patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully and make sure you understand:

- How to prepare the nasal spray.

This medicine is only used in the nose . Do not get it in your eyes or on your skin. If it does get on these areas, rinse them with water right away and call your doctor.

To use nafarelin spray:

- Before you use each new bottle of nafarelin, the spray pump needs to be primed first. To do this, point the bottle away from you and pump the bottle firmly about 7 times until a fine mist spray appears. This only needs to be done once for each new bottle of nafarelin. Be careful not to breathe in this spray. You could inhale extra doses of nafarelin, since the medicine is dissolved in the spray.
- Before you use nafarelin spray, blow your or your child's nose gently to clear the nostrils. You can also use a bulb syringe to clean your child's nose.
- For central precocious puberty: Tilt your child's head back slightly. Put the tip of the bottle into your child's nostril. Close the other nostril with your finger. At the same time, let your child sniff in the spray as you pump the bottle once. Allow 30 seconds between sprays in the same nostril. Keep your child's head tilted back for a few seconds after spraying this medicine to let the spray get onto the back of the nose.
- For endometriosis: Lean your head forward. Put the spray tip into one nostril. Aim the tip toward the back and outside of your nostril. You do not need to put the tip too far into your nose. Close your other nostril with your finger. At the same time, sniff in the spray as you pump the bottle once. Do not spray this medicine in your other nostril unless your doctor tells you to. Tilt your head backwards for a few seconds after spraying this medicine to let the spray get onto the back of your nose.
- Repeat these steps for each dose of the medicine.
- Each time you use the spray bottle, wipe off the tip with a clean tissue or cloth. Keep the white safety clip and plastic cap on the bottle when you are not using it.
- Be sure to clean the tip of the spray bottle before and after every use. To do this, hold the bottle sideways. Rinse the tip with warm water, while wiping the tip with your finger or a soft cloth for about 15 seconds. Dry the tip with a soft cloth or tissue. Replace the cap right after use. Be careful not to get water into the bottle, since this could dilute the medicine.
- Do not try to make the tiny hole in the spray tip larger. Doing so, may deliver a wrong dose of the medicine.

- Tilt your child's head back slightly. Put the tip of the bottle into your child's nostril.
- Close the other nostril with your finger. At the same time, let your child sniff in the spray as you pump the bottle once.

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check the progress of you or your child at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects. Be sure to keep all appointments.

For female patients : You should not use this medicine if you are pregnant or may become pregnant. Using this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Use an effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant during treatment with this medicine. If you think you have become pregnant while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away.

For children using nafarelin spray for central precocious puberty (CPP) : This medicine can cause a brief increase in blood levels of some hormones. During this time, you may notice more signs of puberty in your child, including light vaginal bleeding and breast enlargement in girls. If your child's symptoms do not improve within 4 weeks, or if they get worse, call your doctor.

For adult women using nafarelin spray for endometriosis :

- For the first few days of treatment, the symptoms of your condition may get worse. This is normal. Do not stop using this medicine. Talk with your doctor if you have concerns about this.
- During the time you are using nafarelin, your menstrual period may not be regular or you may not have a menstrual period at all. This is to be expected when being treated with this medicine. If regular menstruation does not begin within 2 to 3 months after you stop using this medicine, check with your doctor.
- During the time you are using nafarelin spray, you should use birth control methods that do not contain hormones, such as condoms, IUD, a diaphragm or a cervical cap with a spermicide. If you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.
- Use a water-based vaginal lubricant product if dryness of the vagina causes problems, such as pain during sexual intercourse. Make sure the lubricant you choose can be used with a latex birth control device if you are using one. Some lubricants contain oils, which can break down the latex rubber of condoms, a cervical cap, or a diaphragm, and cause them to rip or tear.
- This medicine can cause your bone mineral density to decrease, which may lead to osteoporosis or weakened bones. Talk with your doctor about how this risk will affect you.
- If you suspect you may have become pregnant, stop using this medicine and check with your doctor right away. There is a chance that continued use of nafarelin during pregnancy could cause birth defects or a miscarriage.

If you or your caregiver notice any of these side effects, tell your doctor right away.
