## Proper Use

Inhaled ciclesonide is used to prevent asthma attacks. It is not used for an attack that has already started. You should use another medicine for an acute asthma attack. If you do not have another medicine to use or if you have any questions about this, check with your doctor .

This medicine is used with a special inhaler and usually comes with patient directions. Read the directions carefully before using this medicine. If you do not understand the directions or you are not sure how to use the inhaler, check with your doctor or pharmacist .

In order for this medicine to help prevent asthma attacks, it must be used every day in regularly spaced doses, as ordered by your doctor. Up to 4 weeks may pass before you begin to notice improvement in your condition. It may take several months before you feel the full effects of this medicine .

When you use the inhaler for the first time, or if you have not used it for 10 days or longer, it may not deliver the right amount of medicine with the first puff. Therefore, before using the inhaler, test or prime it by spraying the medicine three times into the air away from the face. Check the dose indicator on top of the inhaler if it shows that there are either 60 or 120 puffs left. If the dose indicator is not working correctly, do not use the inhaler and return it to your pharmacy or doctor .

To use the inhaler:

- Remove the cap and look at the mouthpiece to make sure it is clean.
- Breathe out fully, trying to get as much air out of the lungs as possible. Do not blow or breathe into the inhaler.
- Hold the inhaler in the upright position. Put the mouthpiece into your mouth over your tongue and close your lips around it.
- Breathe in through your mouth slowly and deeply, and at the same time firmly press down on the center of the dose indicator with your finger. Hold your breath as long as you can up to 10 seconds. This gives the medicine time to settle in your airways and lungs.
- Take your finger off the center of the dose indicator. Remove the inhaler from your mouth, then breathe out slowly.
- Repeat these steps if more than one dose is needed.
- Replace the cap after each use to keep the mouthpiece clean.
- When you have finished all your doses, rinse your mouth with water and spit it out. Do not swallow. This will help prevent infections in your mouth or throat .

Wipe the mouthpiece with a clean, dry tissue or cloth at least once a week. Do not wash or put any part of your inhaler in water .

Do not interrupt or stop taking this medicine without first checking with your doctor. Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are taking before stopping it completely. Some conditions may become worse when the medicine is stopped suddenly, which can be dangerous .
