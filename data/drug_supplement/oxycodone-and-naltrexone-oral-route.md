# Oxycodone and naltrexone (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Troxyca ER

## Description

Oxycodone and naltrexone combination is used to manage pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment, when other pain medicines did not work well enough or cannot be tolerated. It belongs to the group of medicines called opioid analgesics (pain medicines). Oxycodone acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain.

Oxycodone and naltrexone combination should not be used if you need pain medicine for just a short time, such as when recovering from surgery. Do not use this medicine to relieve mild pain, or in situations when non-opioid medication is effective. This medicine should not be used to treat pain that you only have once in a while or "as needed".

When oxycodone is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, under the close supervision of healthcare providers, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using opioids to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is less likely to occur when opioids are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal symptoms if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal symptoms can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your progress while you are taking this medicine especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of treatment. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to take it. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

Do not use this medicine if you are using or have used an MAO inhibitor (eg, isocarboxazid [Marplan®], linezolid [Zyvox®], phenelzine [Nardil®], selegiline [Eldepryl®], tranylcypromine [Parnate®]) within the past 14 days.

Using this medicine while you are pregnant may cause serious unwanted effects, including neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome in your newborn baby. Tell your doctor right away if you think you are pregnant or if you plan to become pregnant while using this medicine. Tell your doctor right away if your baby has an abnormal sleep pattern, diarrhea, a high-pitched cry, irritability, shakiness or tremors, sneezing, weight loss, vomiting, yawning, or failure to gain weight.

This medicine may be present in your breast milk and passed to your baby. Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking this medicine.

If you think you or someone else may have taken an overdose of this medicine, get emergency help at once . Signs of an overdose include : dark urine, difficult or trouble breathing, irregular, fast or slow, or shallow breathing, nausea or vomiting, pain in the upper stomach, pale or blue lips, fingernails, or skin, pinpoint pupils of the eyes, or yellow eyes or skin. Your doctor may give naloxone to treat an overdose. Naloxone is a medicine that temporarily reverses the effects of an overdose. If you have been prescribed naloxone, make sure household members know how to use this on you in the event of an overdose or suspected overdose. Emergency medical attention is still needed after naloxone is used because the reversal effects are only temporary.

This medicine will add to the effects of alcohol and other CNS depressants (medicines that can make you drowsy or less alert). Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for allergies or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine, other prescription pain medicine or opioids, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics. Check with your doctor before taking any of these medicines while you are using this medicine .

Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur when you get up suddenly from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help lessen this problem. Also, lying down for a while may relieve the dizziness or lightheadedness.

This medicine may make you dizzy, drowsy, or lightheaded. Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you .

Using opioids for a long time can cause severe constipation. To prevent this, your doctor may direct you to take laxatives, drink a lot of fluids, or increase the amount of fiber in your diet. Be sure to follow the directions carefully, because continuing constipation can lead to more serious problems.

This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are using this medicine.

Do not change your dose or suddenly stop using it without checking with your doctor . Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely. This may help prevent worsening of your condition and reduce the possibility of withdrawal symptoms, including chills, runny nose, muscle pain, sweating, restlessness, or yawning.
