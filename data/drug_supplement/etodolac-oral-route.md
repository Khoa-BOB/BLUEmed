## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of etodolac capsules and tablets in the pediatric population and extended-release tablets in children younger than 6 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatrics-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of etodolac in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of etodolac than younger adults, and are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require adjustment of dosage in patients receiving etodolac.
