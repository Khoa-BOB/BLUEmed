## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of ezetimibe and simvastatin combination for the treatment of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) and high cholesterol in the blood in children younger than 10 years of age and for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) in children. Safety and efficacy have not been established.
