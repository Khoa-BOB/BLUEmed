## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

## Description

Topotecan is used to treat small cell lung cancer that has relapsed or gotten worse. It belongs to the group of medicines known as antineoplastics or cancer medicines.

Topotecan interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal cells may also be affected by the medicine, other unwanted effects may occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Some effects, like hair loss, may not be serious but may cause concern. Some unwanted effects may occur after treatment with topotecan has stopped.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
