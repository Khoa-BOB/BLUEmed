# Pegfilgrastim-pbbk (subcutaneous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Fylnetra

## Description

Pegfilgrastim-pbbk injection is used to treat neutropenia (low white blood cells) that is caused by cancer medicines. It is a synthetic (man-made) form of a substance that is naturally produced in your body called a colony stimulating factor. Pegfilgrastim-pbbk helps the bone marrow to make new white blood cells.

Pegfilgrastim-pbbk injection is also used to treat acute radiation syndrome (radiation sickness) in patients who have been exposed to high levels (myelosuppressive doses) of radiation. Myelosuppression is a bone marrow problem that can lead to a decrease in blood cell counts.

When certain cancer medicines are used to fight cancer cells, they also affect the white blood cells that fight infections. Pegfilgrastim-pbbk is used to lower the risk of getting an infection while you are being treated with cancer medicines.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

This medicine lowers the number of some types of blood cells in your body. Because of this, you may bleed more easily. Wash your hands often.
