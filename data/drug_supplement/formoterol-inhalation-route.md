# Formoterol (inhalation route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Foradil Aerolizer

Perforomist

## Description

Formoterol is used together with other medicines (eg, inhaled corticosteroids) to treat asthma and prevent bronchospasm in patients with asthma. When used regularly every day, inhaled formoterol decreases the number and severity of asthma attacks. However, it will not relieve an asthma attack that has already started.

Formoterol is also used for the long-term maintenance treatment of air flow blockage in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. COPD is a long-term lung disease that causes bronchospasm (wheezing or difficulty with breathing).

Formoterol belongs to the family of medicines known as bronchodilators. Bronchodilators are medicines that are breathed in through the mouth to open up the bronchial tubes (air passages) in the lungs. They relieve cough, shortness of breath, and troubled breathing by increasing the flow of air through the bronchial tubes.

Formoterol is also used to prevent troubled breathing or wheezing caused by exercise (exercise-induced bronchospasm or EIB).

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Solution

If your symptoms do not improve within a few days or if they become worse, check with your doctor.

Tell your doctor if you are also using other medicines for your COPD. Your doctor may want you to stop using the medicine and use it only during a severe COPD attack. Follow your doctor's instructions on how you should take your medicine.

This medicine should not be used if you are having a severe COPD attack, or if symptoms of a COPD attack has already started. Your doctor may prescribe another medicine for you to use in case of an acute COPD attack. If the other medicine does not work as well, tell your doctor right away.

This medicine should not be used together with similar inhaled medicines such as arformoterol (Brovana™), budesonide/formoterol (Symbicort®), indacaterol (Arcapta® Neohaler®), salmeterol (Serevent®), or salmeterol/fluticasone (Advair®).

This medicine should only be used as an additional treatment for patients who cannot be treated with other asthma medicines (such as inhaled corticosteroids) or for asthma patients that require two medicines, including formoterol. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.

Talk to your doctor or get medical care right away if:

- Your or your child's symptoms do not improve after using this medicine for 1 week or if they become worse.
- Your short-acting inhaler does not seem to be working as well as usual and you need to use it more often (eg, you use 1 whole canister of your short-acting inhaler in 8 weeks time, or you need to use 4 or more inhalations of your short-acting inhaler for 2 or more days in a row).
- You have a significant decrease in your peak flow when measured as directed by your doctor.
