## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of diazepam tablets and oral liquid in children younger than 6 months of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established. Use of diazepam is not recommended in children younger than 6 months of age.

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of diazepam buccal film in children younger than 2 years of age and older than 5 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established. Diazepam buccal film should not be used in newborns or infants.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of diazepam in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have unwanted effects (eg, severe drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, clumsiness, or unsteadiness) and age-related kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving diazepam.

Use of diazepam buccal film is not recommended in the elderly.
