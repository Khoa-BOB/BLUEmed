## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of fluoxetine in children. However, safety and efficacy have not been established to treat depression in children younger than 8 years of age, to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder in children younger than 7 years of age, and to treat depression that is part of bipolar disorder in children younger than 10 years of age.

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of fluoxetine in children with bulimia nervosa , panic disorder , or treatment resistant depression . Safety and efficacy have not been established.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of fluoxetine in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have hyponatremia (low sodium in the blood) than younger adults, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving fluoxetine.
