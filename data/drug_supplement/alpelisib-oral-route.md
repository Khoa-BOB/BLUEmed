## Description

Alpelisib is used together with other medicines (eg, fulvestrant) to treat hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, PIK3CA­mutated, advanced or metastatic (cancer that has spread) breast cancer. Your doctor will test for the presence of the mutation.

Alpelisib is also used to treat PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS). PROS is a group of rare conditions that cause body parts to grow too much or have an unusual shape.

Alpelisib interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal cells may also be affected by the medicine, other unwanted effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
- Packet
