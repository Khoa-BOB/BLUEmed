## Description

Lamivudine is used in combination with other medicines for the treatment of the infection caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).

Lamivudine will not cure or prevent HIV infection or AIDS. It helps keep HIV from reproducing and appears to slow down the destruction of the immune system. This may help delay the development of serious health problems usually related to AIDS or HIV disease from occurring. Lamivudine will not keep you from spreading HIV to other people. People who receive this medicine may continue to have other problems usually related to AIDS or HIV disease.

Lamivudine is also used to treat chronic (long-term) hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

Do not use this medicine if you or your child is also taking zalcitabine or medicines containing emtricitabine or lamivudine (eg, Atripla®, Combivir®, Complera®, Emtriva®, Epzicom®, Stribild®, Trizivir®, Truvada®). Tell your doctor right away if you are using any of these medicines.

Two rare but serious reactions to this medicine are lactic acidosis (build-up of acid in the blood) and liver toxicity, including an enlarged liver. These are more common if you are female, very overweight (obese), or have been taking anti-HIV medicines for a long time. Call your doctor right away if you or your child has stomach discomfort or cramping, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, a decreased appetite, a general feeling of discomfort, muscle cramping or pain, unusual tiredness or weakness, trouble breathing, or yellow skin or eyes.

This medicine may cause worsening of hepatitis B infection when treatment is stopped. Talk to your doctor if you have any concerns about this.

Pancreatitis may occur while you are using Epivir® . Tell your doctor right away if you or your child has sudden and severe stomach pain, chills, constipation, nausea, vomiting, fever, or lightheadedness.

Your immune system may get stronger when you start using Epivir® . This could cause a hidden infection in your body to become active. Tell your doctor right away if you or your child notice any changes in your health.

Lamivudine does not decrease the risk of transmitting HIV infection or hepatitis B infection to others through sexual contact or by contamination through blood. HIV or hepatitis B may be acquired from or spread to others through infected body fluids, including blood, vaginal fluid, or semen. If you are infected, it is best to avoid any sexual activity involving an exchange of body fluids with other people. If you do have sex, always wear (or have your partner wear) a condom (“rubber”). Only use condoms made of latex or polyurethane and use them every time you have contact with semen, vaginal secretions, or blood. Also, do not re-use or share needles or equipment with anyone. If you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
