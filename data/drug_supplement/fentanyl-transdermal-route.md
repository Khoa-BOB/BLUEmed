## Description

Fentanyl skin patch is used to treat severe pain, including acute pain following surgery. Ionsys® is applied by your healthcare provider in a hospital setting after surgery for the short-term management of acute pain. Duragesic® is used for pain severe enough to require around-the-clock pain relief for a long period of time.

Fentanyl skin patch is also used to treat severe and persistent pain that requires an extended treatment period and when other pain medicines did not work well enough or cannot be tolerated.

The Duragesic® skin patch should not be used if you need pain medicine for just a short time, such as after dental surgery or tonsil surgery. Do not use the patch for mild pain or pain that occurs only once in a while.

Fentanyl is a strong opioid analgesic (pain medicine). It acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain.

When an opioid medicine is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, under the close supervision of a healthcare provider, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using opioids to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is less likely to occur when opioids are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal symptoms if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal symptoms can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely.

This medicine is available only under a restricted distribution program called the Opioid Analgesic REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Patch, Extended Release

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of the Duragesic® patch and Fentanyl extended-release patch in children 2 years of age and older. However, pediatric patients must be opioid-tolerant before using a fentanyl patch . Safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 2 years of age.

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of the Ionsys® patch in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of fentanyl skin patch in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have drowsiness and age-related lung, kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving fentanyl skin patch.

The fentanyl skin patch is only used for opioid-tolerant patients . A patient is opioid-tolerant if oral opioids have already been used for severe pain. Check with your doctor if you have questions about this.

It is very important that you understand the rules of the Opioid Analgesic REMS program to prevent addiction, abuse, and misuse of fentanyl. This medicine should also come with a Medication Guide and patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Read it again each time you refill your prescription in case there is new information. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.

You will receive the Ionsys® patch while you are in a hospital. A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine after surgery. You will be taught how to use this medicine in the hospital, but the patch will be removed by your healthcare provider before you leave the hospital. Do not leave the hospital with the patch on your skin .

To use the Duragesic® patch :

- Use this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor. It will work only if it has been applied correctly.
- This medicine should only be used on skin that is not irritated or injured. Do not put the patch in your mouth, chew it, or swallow it.
- Fentanyl skin patches are packaged in sealed pouches. Do not remove the patch from the sealed pouch until you are ready to apply it.
- When handling the skin patch, be careful not to touch the adhesive (sticky) surface with your hand. The adhesive part of the system contains some fentanyl, which can be absorbed into your body too fast through the skin of your hand. If any of the medicine does get on your hand, rinse the area right away with large amounts of clear water. Do not use soap or other cleansers.
- Be careful not to tear the patch or make any holes in it. Damage to a patch may allow fentanyl to pass into your skin too quickly. This can cause an overdose.
- Apply the patch to a dry, flat skin area on your upper arm, chest, or back. Choose a place where the skin is not very oily and is free of scars, cuts, burns, or irritation. Do not apply this medicine to areas that have received radiation treatment.
- The patch will stay in place better if it is applied to an area with little or no hair. If you need to apply the patch to a hairy area, you may first clip the hair with scissors, but do not shave it off.
- If you need to clean the area before applying the medicine, use only plain water. Do not use soaps, other cleansers, lotions, or anything that contains oils or alcohol. Be sure that the skin is completely dry before applying the medicine.
- Remove the liner covering the sticky side of the skin patch. Then press the patch firmly in place, using the palm of your hand, for a minimum of 30 seconds. Make sure that the entire adhesive surface is attached to your skin, especially around the edges.
- If the patch becomes loose, tape the edges with first aid tape.
- If the patch falls off after applying it, throw it away and apply a new patch in a different area.
- If you need to apply more than 1 patch at a time, place the patches far enough apart so that the edges do not touch or overlap each other.
- Wash your hands with a lot of clear water after applying the medicine. Do not use soap or other cleansers.
- Remove the patch after 3 days (72 hours), or as directed by your doctor. Choose a different place on your skin to apply the next patch. If possible, use a place on the other side of your body. Wait at least 3 days before using the first area again.

To use the Fentanyl extended-release patch :

- Use this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor. It will work only if it has been applied correctly.
- Do not remove the patch from the pouch until you are ready to use. Do not use the patch if the pouch seal is broken or the patch is cut, damaged, or changed in any way.
- This medicine is available in 7 different strengths and patch sizes. Make sure you have the right strength patch that has been prescribed for you.
- Apply the patch on the chest, back, sides of the waist, or upper arm in a place where there is no hair. For children, apply the patch on the upper back.
- Do not put the patch on skin that is oily, burned, broken out, cut, irritated, or damaged. Avoid sensitive areas or those that move around a lot. If there is hair, you may clip the hair, but do not shave it off.
- Clean the skin area with clear water only. Do not use soaps, lotions, oils, or alcohol. Be sure that the skin is completely dry before applying the medicine.
- Remove the liner covering the sticky side of the skin patch. Then press the patch firmly in place, using the palm of your hand and hold for at least 30 seconds. Make sure it sticks well to the skin, especially around the edges.
- If the patch becomes loose, tape the edges with first aid tape. You may instead cover the patch with a transparent adhesive film dressing. Do not cover the patch with any other kind of bandage or tape.
- If the patch falls off after applying, throw it away and apply a new patch in a different area.
- Remove the patch after 3 days or as directed by your doctor. Choose a different place on your skin to apply the next patch.

In young children or persons with decreased mental alertness, the Duragesic® patch should be put on the upper back to decrease the chance that the patch will be removed and placed in the mouth.

After a Duragesic® patch is applied, fentanyl passes into the skin a little at a time. A certain amount of the medicine must build up in the skin before it is absorbed into the body. Up to a full day (24 hours) may pass before the first dose begins to work. Your doctor may need to adjust the dose during the first few weeks before finding the amount that works best for you. Even if you feel that the medicine is not working, do not increase the amount of fentanyl skin patch that you apply. Instead, check first with your doctor.

You will probably need to take a faster-acting opioid by mouth to relieve pain during the first few days of using fentanyl skin patch. You may also need another opioid while your dose of fentanyl is being adjusted, and to relieve any "breakthrough" pain that occurs later on. Be sure you do not take more of the other opioid, and do not take it more often than directed. Taking 2 opioids together can increase the chance of serious side effects.

Do not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while you are using this medicine.

### Storage

Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.

Keep out of the reach of children.

Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.

Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.

Fentanyl can cause serious unwanted effects or a fatal overdose if taken by children, pets, or adults who are not used to strong opioid pain medicines. Make sure you store the medicine in a safe and secure place to prevent others from getting it.

Use the patch-disposal unit that was provided with your prescription to dispose of the patches. Read and follow the printed instructions on the disposal unit and use one unit for each patch. Peel off the liner of the disposal unit to reveal the sticky surface. Place the sticky side of the used patch on the disposal unit and seal the entire package. If the patch has not been used, take it out of the pouch and remove the liner that covers the sticky side before placing it on the disposal unit. Throw the sealed disposal unit in a trash can. Talk to your pharmacist if you have questions about how to use the disposal unit. Do not flush the pouch or the protective liner down the toilet. Put them in a trash can.

Your healthcare provider will dispose of the Ionsys® patch after removing it.

Drop off any unused opioid medicine at a drug take-back location right away. If you do not have a drug take-back location near you, flush any unused opioid medicine down the toilet. Check your local drug store and clinics for take-back locations. You can also check  the DEA web site for locations.

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress while using this medicine. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to take it. Blood and urine tests may needed to check for unwanted effects.

Do not use this medicine if you have used an MAO inhibitor (MAOI) (eg, isocarboxazid [Marplan®], linezolid [Zyvox®], phenelzine [Nardil®], selegiline [Eldepryl®], tranylcypromine [Parnate®]) within the past 14 days.

For nursing mothers taking this medicine :

- Talk to your doctor if you have any questions about taking this medicine or about how it may affect your baby.
- Call your doctor if you become extremely tired and have difficulty caring for your baby.
- Your baby should generally nurse every 2 to 3 hours and should not sleep for more than 4 hours at a time.
- Check with your doctor or hospital emergency room immediately if your baby shows signs of increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, difficulty breathing, or limpness. These may be symptoms of an overdose and need immediate medical attention.

This medicine may be habit-forming. If you feel that the medicine is not working as well, do not use more than your prescribed dose. Call your doctor for instructions.

Fentanyl is a medicine that can harm or cause death to a child . Patients and caregivers should keep this medicine out of the reach of children. Carefully dispose of any partially used units or unused medicine properly.

This medicine will add to the effects of alcohol and other CNS depressants. CNS depressants are medicines that slow down the nervous system, which may cause drowsiness or make you less alert. Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for hay fever, other allergies, or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine, other prescription pain medicine or opioids, benzodiazepines, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics. This effect may last for a few days after you stop using this medicine. Check with your doctor before taking any of the medicines listed while you are using this medicine .

Using this medicine while you are pregnant may cause neonatal withdrawal syndrome in your newborn baby. Tell your doctor right away if your baby has an abnormal sleep pattern, diarrhea, a high-pitched cry, irritability, shakiness or tremors, weight loss, vomiting, or fails to gain weight.

Heat can cause the fentanyl in the patch to be absorbed into your body faster. This may increase the chance of serious side effects or an overdose. While you are using this medicine, do not use a heating pad, electric blanket, heat or tanning lamps, sauna, a sunlamp, or a heated water bed, and do not sunbathe, or take long baths or showers in hot water. Also, check with your doctor if you get a fever.

Call your doctor right away if you have worsening of pain, increased sensitivity to pain, or new pain after taking this medicine. These may be symptoms of opioid-induced hyperalgesia and allodynia.

Check with your doctor right away if you have anxiety, restlessness, a fast heartbeat, fever, sweating, muscle spasms, twitching, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or see or hear things that are not there. These may be symptoms of a serious condition called serotonin syndrome. Your risk may be higher if you also take certain other medicines that affect serotonin levels in your body.

Check with your doctor right away if you have darkening of the skin, diarrhea, dizziness, fainting, loss of appetite, mental depression, nausea, skin rash, unusual tiredness or weakness, or vomiting. These may be symptoms of adrenal gland problems.

Dizziness, lightheadedness, or even fainting may occur when you get up suddenly from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help lessen this problem. Also, lying down for a while may relieve dizziness or lightheadedness.

Do not touch the sticky side of the patch or the gel. Fentanyl can be quickly absorbed through the eyes and mouth and can be extremely dangerous. If you do touch the sticky side of the patch or gel, let your nurse or doctor know right away and rinse the area with large amounts of water. Do not use soaps or other cleansers.

Check with your doctor at regular times while using fentanyl. Be sure to report any side effects.

After you have been using this medicine for awhile, "breakthrough" pain may occur more often than usual, and it may not be relieved by your regular dose of medicine. If this occurs, do not increase the amount of fentanyl skin patch or other opioid that you are using without first checking with your doctor.

The Ionsys® patch must be removed before a procedure called a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. It may cause skin burns if left in place during the procedure.

The Ionsys® patch may cause serious skin reactions. Call you doctor right away if you have blistering, lesions, a rash, redness, or swelling of the skin, especially at the site of application.

Fentanyl may cause some people to become drowsy, dizzy, or lightheaded, or to feel a false sense of well-being. Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you . These effects usually go away after a few days of treatment, when your body gets used to the medicine. However, check with your doctor if drowsiness that is severe enough to interfere with your activities continues for more than a few days.

Nausea or vomiting may occur, especially during the first several days of treatment. Lying down for a while may relieve these effects. However, if they are especially bothersome or if they continue for more than a few days, check with your doctor. You may be able to take another medicine to help prevent these problems.

Using opioids for a long time may cause severe constipation. To prevent this, your doctor may direct you to take laxatives, drink a lot of fluids, or increase the amount of fiber in your diet. Be sure to follow the directions carefully, because continuing constipation can lead to more serious problems.

Be careful about letting other people come in contact with your patch. The patch could stick to someone else, such as when you hug them or if someone helps you put the patch on. If any medicine gets on another person, wash it off right away with clear water.

Before having any kind of surgery (including dental surgery) or emergency treatment, tell the medical doctor or dentist in charge that you are using this medicine. Serious side effects can occur if your medical doctor or dentist gives you certain other medicines without knowing that you are using fentanyl.

You may bathe, shower, or swim while wearing a fentanyl skin patch. However, be careful to wash and dry the area around the patch gently. Rubbing may cause the patch to get loose or come off. If this does occur, throw away the patch and apply a new one in a different place. Make sure the area is completely dry before applying the new patch.

If you have been using this medicine regularly for several weeks or more, do not suddenly stop using it without first checking with your doctor . You may be directed to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping treatment completely to lessen the chance of withdrawal symptoms.

Using too much fentanyl skin patch, or taking too much of another opioid with fentanyl skin patch, may cause an overdose. If this occurs, get emergency help right away. Your healthcare provider may prescribe naloxone to treat an overdose. Naloxone is a medicine that can temporarily reverse the effects of an overdose. If you have been prescribed naloxone, or purchased it over-the-counter, make sure your household members know how to use it in the event of an overdose. Emergency help is still needed after naloxone is used because the reversal effects are only temporary. Symptoms of an overdose include : drowsiness, extreme dizziness or weakness, irregular, fast or slow, or shallow breathing, pale or blue lips, fingernails, or skin, pinpoint pupils, relaxed and calm, slow heartbeat or breathing, seizures, sleepiness, trouble breathing, or cold, clammy skin. Tell your doctor right away if you notice these symptoms. Your doctor may also give naloxone to treat an overdose.

This medicine may cause sleep-related breathing problems (eg, sleep apnea, sleep-related hypoxemia). Your doctor may decrease your dose if you have sleep apnea (stop breathing for short periods during sleep) while using this medicine.

Using too much of this medicine may cause reduced infertility (unable to have children). Talk with your doctor before using this medicine if you plan to have children.

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
