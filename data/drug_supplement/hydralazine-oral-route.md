# Hydralazine (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Apresoline

## Description

Hydralazine is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). It is also used to control high blood pressure in a mother during pregnancy (pre-eclampsia or eclampsia) or in emergency situations when blood pressure is extremely high (hypertensive crisis).

High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure can decrease the risk of heart attacks and strokes.

Hydralazine works by relaxing the blood vessels and increasing the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart while reducing its workload.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
