# Elvitegravir (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Vitekta

## Description

Elvitegravir is used in combination with ritonavir and another HIV medicine (eg, atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, lopinavir, tipranavir) to treat infection caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This medicine is used in patients who are already taking or have received HIV medicines in the past.

Elvitegravir will not cure or prevent HIV infection or AIDS, however, it helps keep HIV from reproducing and appears to slow down the destruction of the immune system. This may help delay the development of problems that usually result from AIDS or HIV disease. Elvitegravir will not keep you from spreading HIV to other people. People who receive this medicine may continue to have some of the problems usually related to AIDS or HIV disease.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Pediatric

### Geriatric
