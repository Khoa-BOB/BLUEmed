## Description

Tadalafil is used to treat men who have erectile dysfunction (also called sexual impotence). Tadalafil belongs to a group of medicines called phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors. These medicines prevent an enzyme called phosphodiesterase type-5 from working too quickly. The penis is one of the areas where this enzyme works.

Erectile dysfunction is a condition where the penis does not harden and expand when a man is sexually excited, or when he cannot keep an erection. When a man is sexually stimulated, his body's normal response is to increase blood flow to his penis to produce an erection. By controlling the enzyme, tadalafil helps to maintain an erection after the penis is stroked by increasing blood flow to the penis. Without physical action to the penis, such as that occurring during sexual intercourse, tadalafil will not work to cause an erection.

Tadalafil is also used to treat men who have signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). BPH is caused by an enlarged prostate. Men with BPH usually have difficulty urinating, a decreased flow of urination, hesitation at the beginning of urination, and a need to get up at night to urinate. Tadalafil will make these symptoms less severe and reduce the chance that prostate surgery will be needed. This medicine is also used to treat erectile dysfunction and signs and symptoms of BPH.

Tadalafil is also used in both men and women to treat the symptoms of pulmonary arterial hypertension to improve your ability to exercise. This is high blood pressure that occurs in the main artery that carries blood from the right side of the heart (the ventricle) to the lungs. When the smaller blood vessels in the lungs become more resistant to blood flow, the right ventricle must work harder to pump enough blood through the lungs. Tadalafil works on the PDE5 enzyme in the lungs to relax the blood vessels. This will increase the supply of blood to the lungs and reduce the workload of the heart.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription. .

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Suspension

## Precautions

It is important that you tell all of your doctors that you take tadalafil . If you need emergency medical care for a heart problem, it is important that your doctor knows when you last took tadalafil.

If you will be taking this medicine for pulmonary arterial hypertension, it is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits . This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to take it. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

If you take tadalafil for pulmonary arterial hypertension , do not take Cialis® or other PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil (Revatio® or Viagra®) or vardenafil (Levitra®). Cialis® also contains tadalafil. If you take too much tadalafil or take it together with these medicines, the chance for side effects will be higher.

If you experience a prolonged erection for more than 4 hours or a painful erection for more than 6 hours, contact your doctor immediately . This condition may require prompt medical treatment to prevent serious and permanent damage to your penis.

This medicine does not protect you against sexually transmitted diseases (including HIV or AIDS). Use protective measures and ask your doctor if you have any questions about this.

It is important to tell your doctor about any heart problems you have now or may have had in the past. This medicine can cause serious side effects in patients with heart problems.

Do not use this medicine if you are also using riociguat (Adempas®) or a nitrate medicine, often used to treat angina (chest pain). Nitrate medicines include nitroglycerin, isosorbide, Imdur®, Nitro-Bid®, Nitrostat®, Nitro-Dur®, Transderm Nitro®, Nitrol® Ointment, and Nitrolingual® Spray. Some illegal ("street") drugs called "poppers" (such as amyl nitrate, butyl nitrate, or nitrite) also contain nitrates. If you need to use a nitrate medicine, take it at least 48 hours after your last dose of tadalafil.

Do not drink excessive amounts of alcohol (eg, 5 or more glasses of wine or 5 or more shots of whiskey) when taking tadalafil. When taken in excess, alcohol can increase your chances of getting a headache or dizziness, increase your heart rate, or lower your blood pressure.

If you experience sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes, contact your doctor immediately .

Check with your doctor right away if you have a sudden decrease in hearing or loss of hearing, which may be accompanied by dizziness and ringing in the ears .

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
