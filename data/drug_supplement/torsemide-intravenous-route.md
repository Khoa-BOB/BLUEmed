# Torsemide (intravenous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Demadex

## Description

Torsemide belongs to the group of medicines called loop diuretics. Torsemide is given to help reduce the amount of water in the body associated with congestive heart failure, liver disease (cirrhosis), or kidney disease. It works by acting on the kidneys to increase the flow of urine .

Torsemide is also used alone or together with other medicines to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the work load of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled .

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription .
