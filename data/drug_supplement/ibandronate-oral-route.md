## Proper Use

This medicine comes with a Medication Guide. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.

Make sure your doctor knows if you are on any special diet, such as a low-sodium or low-sugar diet. Your doctor may recommend that you eat a balanced diet with an adequate amount of calcium and vitamin D (found in milk or other dairy products).

Take ibandronate with a full glass (6 to 8 ounces) of plain water on an empty stomach. It should be taken first thing in the morning at least 60 minutes before any food, beverage, or other medicines. Food and beverages (eg, mineral water, coffee, tea, milk, or juice) will decrease the amount of ibandronate absorbed by the body. Waiting longer than 60 minutes will allow more of the drug to be absorbed. Medicines such as antacids, calcium or vitamin supplements will also decrease the absorption of ibandronate.

Swallow the tablet whole. Do not suck or chew on the tablet because it may cause throat irritation.

Do not lie down for 60 minutes after taking ibandronate. This will help ibandronate reach your stomach faster. It will also help prevent irritation to your esophagus.

It is important that you eat a well-balanced diet with an adequate amount of calcium and vitamin D (found in milk or other dairy products). However, do not take any food, beverages, or calcium or vitamin supplements within 60 minutes or longer after taking ibandronate. To do so may keep this medicine from working properly.
