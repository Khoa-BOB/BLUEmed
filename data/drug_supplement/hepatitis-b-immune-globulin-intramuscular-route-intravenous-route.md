## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits for any problems that may be caused by this medicine. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

Hepatitis B immune globulin injection may cause serious allergic reactions. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash; itching; swelling of the face, tongue, and throat; trouble breathing; or chest pain after receiving the medicine.

If you are also using insulin or other medicine for diabetes, you will need to be aware of the symptoms of hypoglycemia (confusion, irritability, double or blurred vision, and in severe cases seizures or loss of consciousness) because this medicine may affect the results of blood sugar tests. Let your doctor know if you experience hypoglycemia on a regular basis while receiving this medicine.

This medicine is made from donated human blood. Some human blood products have transmitted certain viruses to people who have received them. The risk of getting a virus from medicines made from human blood has been greatly reduced in recent years. This is the result of required testing of human donors for certain viruses, and required testing of the medicine when it is made. Although the risk is low, talk with your doctor if you have concerns.

This medicine may cause blood clots. This is more likely to occur if you have a history of blood clotting problems, heart disease, or atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), or must stay in bed for a long time because of surgery or illness. Check with your doctor right away if you suddenly have chest pain, shortness of breath, a severe headache, leg pain, or problems with vision, speech, or walking.

Talk to your doctor before getting flu shots or other vaccines while receiving or after receiving hepatitis B immune globulin. Some vaccines may not work as well while you are using this medicine.

Make sure any doctor or dentist who treats you knows that you are using this medicine. This medicine may affect the results of certain medical tests (e.g., serological tests).
