## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of furosemide injection to treat fluid retention and swelling in children. However, premature babies are more likely to have unwanted effects (eg, kidney stones, hearing problems), which may require caution in patients receiving furosemide injection.

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of furosemide injection to treat edema (swelling) in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of furosemide injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving furosemide injection.

Studies in women suggest that this medication poses minimal risk to the infant when used during breastfeeding.
