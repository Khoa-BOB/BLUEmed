Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.

### Other Interactions

Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.  Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur.  Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.

## Proper Use

A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine in a hospital or clinic setting. This medicine is given through a needle placed in one of your veins.

This medicine is usually given once a week on a regular schedule. If you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.

You may be taught how to give your medicine at home. Make sure you understand all instructions before you give yourself this medicine. Do not use more medicine or use it more often than your doctor tells you to.

This medicine should come with patient information leaflet. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check you closely while you are receiving this medicine. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to use it.

This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, lightheadedness, dizziness, or fainting, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after you receive this medicine.

Alpha 1-PI is made from donated human blood. Some human blood products have transmitted certain viruses to people who have received them. The risk of getting a virus from alpha 1-PI is very low and has been greatly reduced in recent years. This is the result of required testing of human donors for certain viruses, and testing during the manufacture of these medicines. Although the risk is low, talk with your doctor if you have concerns. Your doctor may give you a hepatitis B vaccine before receiving this medicine.
