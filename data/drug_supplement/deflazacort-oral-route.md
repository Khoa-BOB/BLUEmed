Some examples of live vaccines include measles, mumps, influenza (nasal flu vaccine), poliovirus (oral form), rotavirus, and rubella.

If you use this medicine for a long time, do not suddenly stop using it without checking first with your doctor . You may need to slowly decrease your dose before stopping it completely.

This medicine may cause changes in mood or behavior, including thoughts of suicide for some patients. Tell your doctor right away if you have depression, mood swings, a false or unusual sense of well-being, trouble with sleeping, thoughts of killing oneself, or personality changes while using this medicine.

This medicine may cause thinning of the bones (osteoporosis), loss of blood supply, or slow growth in children if used for a long time. Tell your doctor if you have any bone or joint pain or if you have an increased risk for osteoporosis. If your child is using this medicine, tell the doctor if you think your child is not growing properly.

Check with your doctor right away if you have blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, red skin lesions, severe acne or skin rash, sores or ulcers on the skin, or fever or chills while you are using this medicine.

This medicine may increase your risk for cancer, including Kaposi's sarcoma. Tell your doctor right away if you have flat, painless spots that are red or purple on white skin and bluish, brownish, or black on dark skin.
