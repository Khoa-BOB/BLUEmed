Zavesca

## Description

Miglustat is used to treat mild to moderate type 1 Gaucher disease in people who cannot be treated with an enzyme replacement therapy. Type 1 Gaucher disease is a disease you get from both your parents. People with type 1 Gaucher disease lack an enzyme (naturally occurring substance in your body) that breaks down a chemical in your body called glucosylceramide. Too much glucosylceramide causes liver and spleen enlargement, changes in the blood, and bone disease. Miglustat works by stopping the body from making glucosylceramide.

Miglustat is used in combination with cipaglucosidase alfa-atga injection (Pombiliti™) to treat late-onset of Pompe disease in patients who are not improving on their current enzyme replacement therapy (ERT).

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Capsule
