# Trastuzumab-qyyp (intravenous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Trazimera

## Description

Trastuzumab-qyyp injection is used together with other cancer medicines (eg, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and either paclitaxel or docetaxel, or docetaxel and carboplatin) or used alone after a previous treatment with an anthracycline medicine to treat HER2-overexpressing node-positive or node-negative (ER/PR negative or with one high risk feature) breast cancer.

Trastuzumab-qyyp injection is also used to treat HER2-overexpressing metastatic (cancer that has spread) breast cancer in patients who have received one or more cancer treatments. It is also used together with paclitaxel for the first-line treatment of HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer.

Trastuzumab-qyyp injection is also used together with cisplatin and capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil to treat HER2-overexpressing metastatic (cancer that has spread to other parts of the body) gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma (stomach or esophagus cancer) in patients who have not previously received treatment.

Trastuzumab-qyyp prevents the growth of some tumors that produce extra amounts of a certain substance known as the HER2 protein. It should only be used in patients whose tumors have been shown to produce extra amounts of this protein (HER2 overexpression) .

Trastuzumab-qyyp is a monoclonal antibody. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by trastuzumab-qyyp, other effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Powder for Solution
