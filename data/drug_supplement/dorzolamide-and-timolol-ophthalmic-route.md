## Proper Use

Your eye doctor will tell you how much of this medicine to use and how often. Do not use more medicine or use it more often than your doctor tells you to.

This medicine comes with a patient information insert. Read and follow the instructions in the insert carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.

Use only the brand of this medicine that your doctor prescribed . Do not replace preservative-containing (Cosopt®) with the product without preservative (Cosopt® PF) .

Cosopt® PF eye drops is a sterile solution that does not contain any preservatives. Use the solution in the single-unit containers immediately after opening. Throw away any unused medicine after each use.

If you normally wear soft contact lenses, remove them before you use Cosopt® eye drops. Wait at least for 15 minutes before putting the contact lenses back in.

If you are using Cosopt® PF eye drops , you may not need to remove your contact lenses while using this medicine.

To use the Cosopt® eye drops :

- The bottle is only partially full to provide proper drop control.
- First, wash your hands with soap and water.
- Before using this medicine for the first time, make sure that the safety strip on the bottle is unbroken.
- Tear off the safety strip to break the seal and open the bottle by unscrewing the cap by turning as indicated by the arrows on the top of the cap. Do not pull the cap directly up and away from the bottle.
- Tilt your head back and, pressing your finger gently on the skin just beneath the lower eyelid, pull the lower eyelid away from the eye to make a space. Drop the medicine into this space.
- Invert the bottle, and press lightly the "finger push area" using your thumb or index finger.
- Let go of the eyelid and gently close the eyes. Do not blink. Keep the eyes closed and apply pressure to the inner corner of the eye with your finger for 1 or 2 minutes to allow the medicine to be absorbed by the eye.
- If you think you did not get the drop of medicine into your eye properly, replace the cap on the bottle and tighten. Then, remove by turning the cap in the opposite direction as indicated by the arrows on the top of the cap and repeat the process with another drop.
- Replace the cap by turning until it is firmly touching the bottle. Do not overtighten or you may damage the bottle and cap.
- Immediately after using the eye drops, wash your hands to remove any medicine that may be on them.
- To keep the medicine as germ-free as possible, do not touch the applicator tip to any surface (including the eye). Also, keep the container tightly closed. Serious damage to the eye and possible loss of vision may result from using contaminated eye drops.

To use the Cosopt® PF eye drops :

- This medicine is packaged in a foil pouch containing a strip of single-use containers.
- First, wash your hands with soap and water.
- Pull off one single-use container from the strip. Return the remaining strip of single-use container back in the pouch.
- Hold the single-use container upright. Twist off the tab to open the container.
- Tilt your head backwards or lie down, pressing your finger gently on the skin just beneath the lower eyelid, pull the lower eyelid away from the eye to make a space. Drop the medicine into this space.
- Blot any excess solution from the skin around the eye with a tissue.
- Discard and unused portion from the single use container.

If your doctor ordered two different eye drops to be used together, wait at least 5 or 10 minutes between the times you apply the medicines. This will help to keep the second medicine from “washing out” the first one.
