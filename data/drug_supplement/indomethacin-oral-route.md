This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Capsule
- Suspension
- Capsule, Extended Release

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of indomethacin capsules, suspension, and suppositories in children younger than 14 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of Tivorbex® capsules in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of indomethacin in the elderly. However, elderly patients may be more sensitive to the effects of indomethacin than younger adults, and are more likely to have unwanted side effects (eg, confusion, psychosis) and age-related kidney or stomach problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving indomethacin.
