# Cabotegravir and rilpivirine (intramuscular route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Cabenuva

## Description

Cabotegravir and rilpivirine combination injection are used together for the treatment of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This medicine is usually given to patients to replace their current anti-HIV medicines when their healthcare provider determines that they meet certain requirements.

Cabotegravir and rilpivirine combination injection will not cure or prevent HIV infection or AIDS. It helps keep HIV from reproducing and appears to slow down the destruction of the immune system. This may help delay problems that are usually related to AIDS or HIV disease from occurring. This medicine will not keep you from spreading HIV to other people. People who receive this medicine may continue to have other problems usually related to AIDS or HIV disease.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Suspension, Extended Release

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of cabotegravir and rilpivirine combination injection in the elderly.

Only use condoms made of latex or polyurethane and use them every time you have contact with semen, vaginal secretions, or blood. Also, do not share needles or equipment with anyone or use dirty needles. If you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.
