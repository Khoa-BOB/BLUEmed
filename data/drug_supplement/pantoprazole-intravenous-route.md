## Description

Pantoprazole injection is used to treat certain conditions in which there is too much acid in the stomach. It is used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and a history of erosive esophagitis (EE) for up to 10 days in adults and up to 7 days in children 3 months and older. GERD is a condition in which the acid in the stomach washes back up into the esophagus. This medicine may also be used to treat other conditions in which the stomach produces too much acid, including Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.

Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). It works by decreasing the amount of acid produced by the stomach.

This medicine is given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
