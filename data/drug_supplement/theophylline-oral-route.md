They relieve cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, and troubled breathing by increasing the flow of air through the bronchial tubes.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of theophylline in children. However, children younger than 1 year of age are more likely to have serious side effects, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving theophylline.

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of theophylline in the elderly. However, elderly patients may be more sensitive to the effects of theophylline than younger adults, and are more likely to have kidney, liver, heart, or lung problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving theophylline.
