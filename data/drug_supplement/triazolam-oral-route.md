Tell your doctor right away if you learn that any of these has happened.

This medicine will add to the effects of alcohol and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants.

Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you .

Do not stop using this medicine without checking first with your doctor . Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely. This may help prevent a worsening of your condition and reduce the possibility of withdrawal symptoms, including seizures, stomach or muscle cramps, sweating, tremors, vomiting, or unusual behavior.

If you develop any unusual and strange thoughts or behavior while you are using triazolam, be sure to discuss it with your doctor. Some changes that have occurred in people using this medicine are like those seen in people who drink alcohol and then act in a manner that is not normal.
