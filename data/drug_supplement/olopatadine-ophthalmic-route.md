## Proper Use

Your eye doctor will tell you how much of this medicine to use and how often. Do not use more medicine or use it more often than your doctor tells you to.

If you are wearing contact lenses, remove them before putting the drops in your eyes. Wait at least 10 minutes after using this medicine before putting them back in. Do not wear contact lenses if your eyes are red.

Use only the brand of this medicine that your doctor prescribed. Different brands may not work the same way.

To use the eye drops:

- First, wash your hands. Tilt your head back and, pressing your finger gently on the skin just beneath the lower eyelid, pull the lower eyelid away from the eye to make a space. Drop the medicine into this space. Let go of the eyelid and gently close the eye. Do not blink. Keep the eye closed for 1 or 2 minutes to allow the medicine to cover the eye.
- If you think you did not get the drop of medicine into your eye properly, repeat the directions with another drop.
- To keep the medicine as germ-free as possible, do not touch the applicator tip to any surface (including the eye). Also, keep the container tightly closed.

Do not use if the liquid changes color or become cloudy.

If you are also using other eye products while using Pataday® , wait at least 5 minutes between each product.
