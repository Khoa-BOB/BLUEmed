## Description

Hydroxyurea is used to treat cancer of the white blood cells called chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). It may also be given together with radiation treatment for head and neck cancer (advanced squamous cell cancer). Hydroxyurea interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body.

Hydroxyurea is used to prevent painful episodes and reduce the need for blood transfusions in patients with sickle cell anemia. It works by making the red blood cells more flexible.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

Using this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. If you are a woman who can get pregnant, your doctor may do tests to make sure you are not pregnant before starting this medicine. Women should use an effective form of birth control during treatment with this medicine and for at least 6 months after the last dose. Men should use an effective form of birth control during treatment and for at least 1 year for Droxia®, Hydrea®, and Xromi® and at least 6 months for Siklos® after the last dose to prevent pregnancy in a sexual partner. If a pregnancy occurs while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away.

Hydroxyurea can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood which increases the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:

- If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.
- Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.
- Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.
- Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.
- Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.
- Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.

Check with your doctor right away if you have back, leg, or stomach pains, bleeding gums, chills, dark urine, difficulty breathing, fever, general body swelling, headache, loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting, nosebleeds, pale skin, sore throat, unusual tiredness or weakness, or yellowing of the eyes or skin. These may be symptoms of a blood problem called hemolytic anemia.

Using this medicine for a long time may increase your risk of developing leukemia (cancer of the blood) or skin cancer. Use a sunscreen and protective clothing to protect your skin. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about this risk.

If you had radiation treatment in the past, Hydrea® may cause your skin to become very red when you have radiation again. Tell your doctor right away if you have darkening or reddening of the skin.

While you are being treated with hydroxyurea, do not have any immunizations (vaccinations) without your doctor's approval. Live virus vaccinations (eg, nasal flu virus vaccine) should not be given while you are using hydroxyurea.

This medicine may increase your risk of having lung or breathing problems (eg, interstitial lung disease). Check with your doctor right away if you develop a fever, cough, or trouble breathing while using this medicine.

Make sure any doctor or dentist who treats you knows that you are using this medicine. The results of some tests (eg, continuous glucose monitor) may be affected by this medicine.

Talk with your doctor before using this medicine if you plan to have children. Some men who use this medicine have become infertile (unable to have children).

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
