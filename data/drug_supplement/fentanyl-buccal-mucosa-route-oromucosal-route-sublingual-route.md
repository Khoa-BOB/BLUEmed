## Description

Fentanyl is used to treat severe pain in cancer patients. It is used for breakthrough cancer pain, which are flares of pain that “break through” after a routine pain medicine has been used. Fentanyl belongs to the group of medicines called opioid analgesics. It is only used in patients who are already taking opioid analgesics .

Fentanyl acts in the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain. Some of its side effects are also caused by actions in the CNS. When an opioid is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming or cause mental or physical dependence. However, under the close supervision of a healthcare provider, people who have continuous pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using opioids to relieve pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is less likely to occur when opioids are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal symptoms if treatment is stopped suddenly. Withdrawal symptoms can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before the medicine is stopped completely. Talk to your doctor about the benefits of this medicine and how to prevent withdrawal symptoms.

This medicine is available only under a restricted distribution program called the TIRF (Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl) REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Spray
- Tablet
- Lozenge/Troche

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of fentanyl in children younger than 18 years of age for the Abstral®, Fentora®, Onsolis®, and Subsys® brands, and in children younger than 16 years of age for the Actiq® brand. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of fentanyl in the elderly. However, elderly patients may be more sensitive to the effects of opioid analgesics than younger adults and are more likely to have age-related lung or kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving fentanyl in order to avoid serious side effects.

Using this medicine while you are pregnant may cause serious unwanted effects, including neonatal withdrawal syndrome in your newborn baby. Tell your doctor right away if you think you are pregnant or if you plan to become pregnant while using this medicine.

For nursing mothers taking this medicine :

- Talk to your doctor if you have any questions about taking this medicine or about how it may affect your baby.
- Call your doctor if you become extremely tired and have difficulty caring for your baby.
- Your baby should generally nurse every 2 to 3 hours and should not sleep for more than 4 hours at a time.
- Check with your doctor or hospital emergency room immediately if your baby shows signs of increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, difficulty breathing, or limpness. These may be symptoms of an overdose and need immediate medical attention.

Fentanyl is a medicine that can harm or cause death to a child . Patients and caregivers should keep this medicine out of the reach of children. Carefully dispose of any partially used units or unused medicine properly.

This medicine may be habit-forming. If you feel that the medicine is not working as well, do not use more than your prescribed dose. Call your doctor for instructions.

This medicine may cause sleep-related breathing problems (eg, sleep apnea, sleep-related hypoxemia). Your doctor may decrease your dose if you have sleep apnea while using this medicine.

This medicine will add to the effects of alcohol and other CNS depressants. Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for allergies or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine, other prescription pain medicine or opioids, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics (numbing medicines), including some dental anesthetics. This effect may last for a few days after you stop using this medicine. Check with your doctor before taking any of these medicines while you are using this medicine .

Fentanyl may cause some people to become drowsy, confused, or dizzy. Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy or not alert . Check with your doctor if you have confusion or drowsiness that is severe enough to interfere with your daily activities.

Using opioids for a long time can cause severe constipation. To prevent this, your doctor may tell you to take laxatives, drink fluids, or increase the amount of fiber in your diet. Follow the directions carefully. Constipation that continues can lead to more serious problems.

If you have been using this medicine regularly for several weeks or more, do not suddenly stop using it without checking with your doctor . You may be directed to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely to lessen the chance of withdrawal symptoms.

If you think you have, or someone else has, taken an overdose of this medicine, get emergency help at once. Your healthcare provider may prescribe naloxone to treat an overdose. Naloxone is a medicine that can temporarily reverse the effects of an overdose. If you have been prescribed naloxone, or purchased it over-the-counter, make sure your household members know how to use it in the event of an overdose. Emergency help is still needed after naloxone is used because the reversal effects are only temporary. Signs of an overdose include : change or loss of consciousness, cold, clammy skin, coughing that sometimes produces a pink frothy sputum, decreased awareness or responsiveness, extreme dizziness or weakness, increased sweating, irregular, fast, or slow, or shallow breathing, pale or blue lips, fingernails, or skin, sleepiness or unusual drowsiness, slow heartbeat, seizures, swelling in legs and ankles, or trouble breathing. Call your doctor right away if you notice these symptoms.

The Actiq® product contains sugar and may increase your chance for tooth decay. Schedule regular dentist visits if you are using Actiq®.

Call your doctor right away if you have worsening of pain, increased sensitivity to pain, or new pain after taking this medicine. These may be symptoms of opioid-induced hyperalgesia and allodynia.

Check with your doctor right away if you have anxiety, restlessness, a fast heartbeat, fever, sweating, muscle spasms, twitching, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or see or hear things that are not there. These may be symptoms of a serious condition called serotonin syndrome. Your risk may be higher if you also take certain other medicines that affect serotonin levels in your body.

This medicine may cause adrenal gland problems. Check with your doctor right away if you have darkening of the skin, diarrhea, dizziness, fainting, loss of appetite, mental depression, nausea, skin rash, unusual tiredness or weakness, or vomiting.

Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur when you get up suddenly from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help lessen this problem. Also, lying down for a while may relieve dizziness or lightheadedness.

Using too much of this medicine may cause infertility (unable to have children). Talk with your doctor before using this medicine if you plan to have children.

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal (eg, St. John's wort) or vitamin supplements.
