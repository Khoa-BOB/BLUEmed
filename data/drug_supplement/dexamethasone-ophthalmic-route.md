Use Maxidex® only as directed by your doctor . Do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may increase the chance of too much medicine being absorbed into the body and the chance of side effects.

To use the eye drops:

- Wash your hands first with soap and water.
- Shake the bottle well before each use.
- Tilt your head back and, pressing your finger gently on the skin just beneath the lower eyelid, pull the lower eyelid away from the eye to make a space. Drop the medicine into this space.
- Let go of the eyelid and gently close your eye. Do not blink. Keep the eye closed and apply pressure to the inner corner of your eye with your finger for 1 or 2 minutes to allow the medicine to be absorbed by the eye.
- If you think you did not get the drop of medicine into your eye properly, use another drop.
