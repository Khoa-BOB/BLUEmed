## Description

Nelfinavir is usually used in combination with other medicines in the treatment of the infection caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).

People who receive this medicine may continue to have other problems usually related to AIDS or HIV disease.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

If you cannot swallow the tablet whole, you may dissolve it in a small amount of water. Be sure to drink or swallow the entire mixture right away. Then refill the glass with water and drink it so none of the medicine is left on the sides of the glass.

Using this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Birth control pills may not work as well to prevent pregnancy when used with this medicine. Use another form of birth control (eg, condoms, spermicide) along with your pills. If you think you have become pregnant while using this medicine, tell your doctor right away.

This medicine may increase blood sugar levels. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child notice a change in the results of your blood or urine sugar tests, or if you have confusion, nausea or vomiting, increased hunger, thirst or urination, or unusual tiredness or weakness.

This medicine will not keep you from giving HIV to your partner during sex. Make sure you understand this and practice safe sex, even if your partner also has HIV, by using a latex condom or other barrier method.
