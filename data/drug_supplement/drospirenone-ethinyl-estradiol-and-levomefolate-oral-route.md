## Description

Drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol, and levomefolate combination is used to prevent pregnancy. It is a birth control pill that contains two types of hormones, ethinyl estradiol and drospirenone, and when taken properly, prevents pregnancy. It works by stopping a woman's egg from fully developing each month. The egg can no longer accept a sperm and fertilization (pregnancy) is prevented.

This medicine is also used to treat premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and acne in women at least 14 years of age. PMDD is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Patients with PMDD may have severe emotional and physical symptoms a few days before their menstrual flow starts.

This medicine also contains levomefolate, which is a form of folic acid. Folic acid is one of the B vitamins that pregnant women need to help prevent neural tube defects in a baby.

No contraceptive method is 100 percent effective. Birth control methods such as having surgery to become sterile or not having sex are more effective than birth control pills. Discuss your options for birth control with your doctor.

This medicine does not prevent AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases. It will not help as emergency contraception, such as after unprotected sexual contact.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
