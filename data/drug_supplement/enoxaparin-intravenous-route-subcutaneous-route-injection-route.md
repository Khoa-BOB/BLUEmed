# Enoxaparin (intravenous route, subcutaneous route, injection route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Lovenox

## Description

Enoxaparin injection is used to prevent deep venous thrombosis, a condition in which harmful blood clots form in the blood vessels of the legs. These blood clots can travel to the lungs and can become lodged in the blood vessels of the lungs, causing a condition called pulmonary embolism. This medicine is used for several days after hip or knee replacement surgery, and in some cases following abdominal or stomach surgery, while you are unable to walk. It is during this time that blood clots are most likely to form. It is also used if you are unable to get out of bed because of a serious illness. In addition, enoxaparin is used to prevent blood clots from forming in the arteries of the heart during certain types of chest pain and heart attacks.

Enoxaparin injection is used together with warfarin to treat acute deep vein thrombosis with or without pulmonary embolism. It is also used to treat certain types of acute heart attacks.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of enoxaparin injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of enoxaparin injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have bleeding problems and age-related kidney disease, which may require an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving enoxaparin injection, especially those who weigh less than 45 kilograms (kg).

Keep out of the reach of children.

Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.

Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure this medicine is working properly. Blood tests will be needed to check for unwanted effects. Be sure to keep all appointments.

Make sure any doctor or dentist who treats you knows that you are using this medicine. You may need to stop using this medicine several days before having surgery or medical tests.

This medicine lowers the number of some types of blood cells in your body. Because of this, you may bleed more easily. Stay away from rough sports or other situations where you could be bruised, cut, or injured. Brush and floss your teeth gently. Be careful when using sharp objects, including razors and fingernail clippers.

Enoxaparin may cause bleeding problems. This risk is higher if you have a catheter in your back for pain medicine or anesthesia (sometimes called an "epidural"), or if you have kidney problems. The risk of bleeding increases if your kidney problems get worse. Check with your doctor right away if you have any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, bleeding gums, blood in the urine or stools, tingling, numbness, or weakness of the lower legs, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.

Lovenox® multiple-dose vials contain benzyl alcohol as a preservative. Tell your doctor right away if you are pregnant or have had an allergic reaction to benzyl alcohol.

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
