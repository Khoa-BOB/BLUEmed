# Tenofovir (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Viread

## Description

Tenofovir is used in combination with other medicines for the treatment of the infection caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV is the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

Tenofovir will not cure or prevent HIV infection or AIDS. It helps keep HIV from reproducing and appears to slow down the destruction of the immune system. This may help delay problems that are usually related to AIDS or HIV disease from occurring. Tenofovir will not keep you from spreading HIV to other people. People who receive this medicine may continue to have some of the problems usually related to AIDS or HIV disease.

Tenofovir is also used to treat chronic (long-term) hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
- Powder

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of tenofovir in children younger than 2 years of age and weighing less than 10 kilograms (kg). Safety and efficacy have not been established.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of tenofovir in the elderly.

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

Do not use this medicine if you or your child are also taking adefovir, Atripla®, Biktarvy®, Complera®, Descovy®, Genvoya®, Hepsera®, Odefsey®, Stribild®, Truvada®, or Vemlidy®. Tell your doctor right away if you or your child are using any of these medicines. Do not start using tenofovir until your doctor tells you to.

Two rare but serious reactions to this medicine are lactic acidosis (build-up of acid in the blood) and liver toxicity. These are more common if you are female, very overweight (obese), or have been taking antiviral medicines for a long time. Call your doctor right away if you or your child have stomach discomfort or cramping, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, a decreased appetite, general feeling of discomfort, muscle cramping or pain, unusual tiredness or weakness, trouble breathing, or yellow skin or eyes.

Do not change your dose or stop using this medicine, even for a short time, without talking to your doctor .

This medicine may increase your risk of having broken bones (fractures). Ask your doctor if you or your child have any concerns about this.

This medicine may increase the risk for kidney problems, including kidney failure. To reduce this risk, be sure to follow up with all blood tests your doctor may order, and avoid other medications that may injure the kidneys, such as certain other antiviral medicines or NSAID pain medicines.

Your immune system may get stronger when you start using HIV medicines. Tell your doctor right away if you or your child notice any changes in your health. Sometimes the immune system will start to fight infections that were hidden in your body, such as pneumonia or tuberculosis. Autoimmune disorders (eg, Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) may also occur.

This medicine does not decrease the risk of transmitting the HIV infection to others through sexual contact or by contaminated blood. Make sure you understand and practice safe sex, even if your partner also has HIV. Avoid sharing needles with anyone.

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
