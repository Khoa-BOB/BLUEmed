# Captopril (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Capoten

## Description

Captopril is used alone or together with other medicines to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure can reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks.

Captopril works by blocking a substance in the body that causes blood vessels to tighten. As a result, the blood vessels relax. This lowers blood pressure and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.

Captopril is also used to help treat heart failure. It is also used in some patients after a heart attack. After a heart attack, some of the heart muscle becomes damaged and weak. The heart muscle may continue to weaken as time goes by. This makes it more difficult for the heart to pump blood. Captopril may be started within the first few days after a heart attack to increase survival rate.

Captopril is also used to treat kidney problems caused by diabetes (diabetic nephropathy).

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
