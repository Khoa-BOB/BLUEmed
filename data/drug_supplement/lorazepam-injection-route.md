## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals.

### Pediatric
