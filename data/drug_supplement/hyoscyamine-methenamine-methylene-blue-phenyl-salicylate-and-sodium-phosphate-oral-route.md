## Description

Urelle® is a combination of five medicines: hyoscyamine, methenamine, methylene blue, phenyl salicylate, and sodium phosphate. It is used to relieve discomfort, swelling, pain, frequent urge to urinate, and cramps or spasms of the urinary tract caused by an infection or a diagnostic procedure.

Hyoscyamine is an antispasmodic drug, which relieves muscle cramps or spasms. Methenamine and methylene blue are antiseptic drugs, which help clear a urinary tract infection. Phenyl salicylate is a pain reliever. Sodium phosphate makes the urine more acidic, which helps methenamine work better.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
- Capsule
