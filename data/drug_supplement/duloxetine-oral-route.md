This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Capsule, Delayed Release

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of duloxetine in children to treat anxiety in children 7 years of age and older. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 7 years of age.

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of duloxetine in children to treat fibromyalgia in children 13 years of age and older. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 13 years of age.

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of duloxetine for other indications in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established for other indications.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of duloxetine in the elderly. However, elderly patients may be more sensitive to the effects of this medicine than younger adults, and are more likely to have hyponatremia (low sodium in the blood) and increase risk for falls, which may require caution in patients receiving duloxetine.

It is important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to allow for changes in your dose and to help prevent any unwanted effects.

Do not take duloxetine with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor (eg, isocarboxazid [Marplan®], phenelzine [Nardil®], selegiline [Eldepryl®], or tranylcypromine [Parnate®]) in the past 2 weeks. Do not start taking an MAO inhibitor within 5 days of stopping duloxetine. If you do, you may develop confusion, agitation, restlessness, stomach or intestinal symptoms, sudden high body temperature, extremely high blood pressure, or severe convulsions. Ask your doctor if you are not sure if you take an MAOI, including linezolid (Zyvox®) or methylene blue injection.

Duloxetine may cause some teenagers and young adults to be agitated, irritable, or display other abnormal behaviors. It may also cause some people to have suicidal thoughts and tendencies or to become more depressed. Some people may have trouble sleeping, get upset easily, have a big increase in energy, or start to act reckless. If you or your caregiver notice any of these unwanted effects, tell your doctor right away. Let the doctor know if you or anyone in your family has bipolar disorder (manic-depressive) or has tried to commit suicide.

Check with your doctor right away if you have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.

Duloxetine may cause a serious condition called serotonin syndrome if taken together with some medicines. Do not use duloxetine with buspirone (Buspar®), fentanyl (Abstral®, Duragesic®), lithium (Eskalith®, Lithobid®), tryptophan, St. John's wort, amphetamines, or some pain or migraine medicines (eg, meperidine, methadone, rizatriptan, sumatriptan, tramadol, Demerol®, Methadose®, Frova®, Imitrex®, Maxalt®, Relpax®, Ultram®, Zomig®). Check with your doctor first before using any other medicines with duloxetine .

This medicine may increase your risk for bleeding problems. Make sure your doctor knows if you are also taking other medicines that thin the blood, such as aspirin, NSAID pain medicines (eg, ibuprofen, naproxen, Advil®, Aleve®, Celebrex®, or Motrin®) or warfarin (Coumadin®).

Do not suddenly stop taking this medicine without checking first with your doctor . If you have been instructed to stop taking duloxetine, ask your doctor how to slowly decrease the dose. This will decrease your chance of having withdrawal symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, headaches, vomiting, increased sweating, irritability, nightmares, trouble with sleeping, or prickling or tingling feelings.

This medicine may affect blood sugar levels. If you are diabetic and notice a change in the results of your blood or urine sugar tests, check with your doctor.

This medicine may cause blurred vision, dizziness, drowsiness, trouble with thinking, or trouble with controlling body movements, which may lead to falls, fractures, or other injuries.

You may also feel lightheaded or you may fall or faint when getting up suddenly from a lying or sitting position, so get up slowly. If these symptoms are bothering you or keeping you from doing your daily activities, tell your doctor right away.

You will need to measure your blood pressure before starting this medicine and while you are using it. If you notice any change to your recommended blood pressure, call your doctor right away. If you have questions about this, talk to your doctor.

Check with your doctor right away if you have confusion, decreased urine output, difficulty concentrating, fast or irregular heartbeat, headaches, memory problems, nausea or vomiting, swelling of the face, ankles, or hands, trouble breathing, or unusual tiredness or weakness.
