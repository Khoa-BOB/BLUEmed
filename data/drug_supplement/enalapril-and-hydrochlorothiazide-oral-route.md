# Enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Vaseretic

## Description

Enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide combination is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure can reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks.

Enalapril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. It works by blocking a substance in the body that causes the blood vessels to tighten. As a result, enalapril relaxes the blood vessels. This lowers blood pressure and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.

Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic (water pill). It reduces the amount of water in the body by increasing the flow of urine which helps lower the blood pressure.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
