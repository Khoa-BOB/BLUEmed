## Proper Use

For patients using the ophthalmic suspension (eye drops) form of this medicine:

- Always shake the container very well just before applying the eye drops.
- To use: First, wash your hands. Tilt the head back and, pressing your finger gently on the skin just beneath the lower eyelid, pull the lower eyelid away from the eye to make a space. Drop the medicine into this space. Let go of the eyelid and gently close the eyes. Do not blink. Keep the eyes closed and apply pressure to the inner corner of the eye with your finger for 1 or 2 minutes to allow the medicine to be absorbed by the eye. If you think you did not get the drop of medicine into your eye properly, use another drop. To keep the medicine as germ-free as possible, do not touch the applicator tip to any surface (including the eye). Always keep the container tightly closed.
