## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

NexIUM I.V.

## Description

Esomeprazole injection is used to treat conditions where there is too much acid in the stomach. It is used for the short-term treatment (up to 10 days) of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with erosive esophagitis in adults and children 1 month of age and older. GERD is a condition where the acid in the stomach washes back up into the esophagus. This medicine is also used to lower the risk of rebleeding in patients with acute gastric or duodenal ulcer after endoscopy.

Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). It works by decreasing the amount of acid that is produced by the stomach.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Powder for Solution
