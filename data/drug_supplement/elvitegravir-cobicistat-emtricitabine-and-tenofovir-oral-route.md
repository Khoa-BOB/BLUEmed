## Brand Name

Stribild

## Description

Elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir combination is used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This medicine is usually given to adult patients who have yet not received any medicine for HIV infection.

Elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir combination will not cure or prevent HIV infection or AIDS. It helps keep HIV from reproducing and appears to slow down the destruction of the immune system. This may help delay problems that are usually related to AIDS or HIV disease from occurring. This medicine will not keep you from spreading HIV to other people. People who receive this medicine may continue to have other problems usually related to AIDS or HIV disease.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
