Tbo-filgrastim injection is used to treat severe neutropenia (low white blood cells) that is caused by cancer medicines. It is a synthetic (man-made) form of a substance that is naturally produced in the body called a colony stimulating factor. Tbo-filgrastim helps the bone marrow to make new white blood cells.
