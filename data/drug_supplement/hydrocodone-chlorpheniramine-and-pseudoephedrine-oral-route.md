## Description

Hydrocodone, chlorpheniramine, and pseudoephedrine combination is used to relieve cough and nasal congestion associated with the common cold allergy.

Hydrocodone is an opioid antitussive (cough suppressant). It acts directly on the cough center in the brain to relieve cough. Chlorpheniramine is an antihistamine, which is used to relieve or prevent symptoms of an allergy. Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant, which decreases nasal congestion by narrowing the blood vessels and reducing blood flow to the nasal passage.

When hydrocodone is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, people who have continuing cough and nasal congestion should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using opioids to relieve their cough. Mental dependence (addiction) is less likely to occur when opioids are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal symptoms if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal symptoms can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your progress while you are using this medicine. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to take it. If your cough does not improve or if it gets worse within 5 days, call your doctor.

Do not use this medicine if you have used an MAO inhibitor (MAOI) such as Eldepryl®, Marplan®, Nardil®, or Parnate® within the past 14 days.

If you think you or someone else may have taken an overdose of this medicine, get emergency help at once . Your doctor may also give naloxone to treat an overdose. Naloxone is a medicine that temporarily reverses the effects of an overdose. If you have been prescribed naloxone, make sure household members know how to use this on you in the event of an overdose or suspected overdose. Emergency medical attention is still needed after naloxone is used because the reversal effects are only temporary. Symptoms of an overdose include: extreme dizziness or weakness, dark urine, trouble breathing, irregular, fast or slow, or shallow breathing, nausea or vomiting, pain in the upper stomach, pale or blue lips, fingernails, or skin, pinpoint pupils of the eyes, or yellow eyes or skin.

This medicine may be habit-forming. If you feel that the medicine is not working as well, do not use more than your prescribed dose . Call your doctor for instructions.

This medicine may make you dizzy or drowsy. Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you .

This medicine will add to the effects of alcohol and other CNS depressants (medicines that can make you drowsy or less alert). Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for allergies or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine, other prescription pain medicine or opioids, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics. Check with your doctor before taking any of these medicines while you are using this medicine .

Using opioids for a long time can cause severe constipation. To prevent this, your doctor may direct you to take laxatives, drink a lot of fluids, or increase the amount of fiber in your diet. Be sure to follow the directions carefully, because continuing constipation can lead to more serious problems.

Using this medicine while you are pregnant may cause serious unwanted effects, including neonatal withdrawal syndrome in your newborn baby. Tell your doctor right away if you think you are pregnant or if you plan to become pregnant while using this medicine.

Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur when you get up suddenly from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help lessen this problem. Also, lying down for a while may relieve the dizziness or lightheadedness.

This medicine may cause adrenal insufficiency. Check with your doctor right away if you have darkening of the skin, diarrhea, dizziness, fainting, loss of appetite, mental depression, nausea, skin rash, unusual tiredness or weakness, or vomiting.

If you are especially sensitive to the effects of this medicine, do not suddenly stop using it without first checking with your doctor . Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely. This may help reduce the possibility of withdrawal symptoms, such as abdominal or stomach cramps, anxiety, fever, nausea, runny nose, sweating, tremors, or trouble sleeping.

Using too much of this medicine may cause infertility (unable to have children). Talk with your doctor before using this medicine if you plan to have children.

Make sure any doctor or dentist who treats you knows that you are using this medicine. This medicine may affect the results of certain medical tests.
