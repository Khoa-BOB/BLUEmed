## Proper Use

Loracarbef should be taken at least 1 hour before or at least 2 hours after meals.

To help clear up your infection completely, keep taking loracarbef for the full time of treatment, even if you begin to feel better after a few days. If you have a ``strep'' infection, you should keep taking this medicine for at least 10 days. This is especially important in ``strep'' infections. Serious heart problems could develop later if your infection is not cleared up completely. Also, if you stop taking this medicine too soon, your symptoms may return.

This medicine works best when there is a constant amount in the blood or urine. To help keep the amount constant, do not miss any doses. Also, it is best to take the doses at evenly spaced times, day and night. If this interferes with your sleep or other daily activities, or if you need help in planning the best times to take your medicine, check with your health care professional.
