## Description

Ranibizumab is used to treat neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD). It is also used in diabetic patients who have diabetic macular edema (DME). Susvimo® is used in patients who have responded to at least 2 injections of a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor. AMD is a disorder of the retina in the eye that causes blurring of vision or blindness. Ranibizumab works by changing the amount of blood that gets to the eye.

Ranibizumab is also used to treat diabetic retinopathy (eye problem caused by diabetes).

Ranibizumab is used to treat macular edema (swelling of the back of the eye) after retinal vein occlusion (a blood vessel in the eye is blocked). Macular edema can cause loss of vision. This medicine is also used to treat myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV).

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Solution
- Implant

## Proper Use

Lucentis®: An ophthalmologist (eye doctor) will give you this medicine as a shot into the eye. This medicine is usually given once a month (about every 28 days). In some patients, it may be given once every 3 months after the first 4 injections.

Susvimo®: This medicine is an implant that is inserted through the white part of the eye (sclera) by a doctor. Your doctor will refill the implant device every 6 months (at least every 24 weeks) for AMD and DME and every 9 months (at least every 36 weeks) for diabetic retinopathy . Your doctor will give you instructions to follow after you receive the implant or the refill, and after the implant is removed.

This medicine should come with a Medication Guide. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.

### Missed Dose

Call your doctor or pharmacist for instructions.

## Precautions

Your eye doctor will want to check your progress at regular visits , especially during the first few days after you receive this medicine, to make sure this medicine is working properly and to check for unwanted effects.

Receiving this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Use an effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant during treatment and for at least 12 months after the last dose. If you think you have become pregnant while receiving this medicine, tell your doctor right away.

Serious eye or vision problems (eg, eye infection, bleeding, or swelling, retinal detachment, conjunctival bleb, erosion, retinal vasculitis with or without occlusion, or retraction) may occur with this medicine. Check with your eye doctor right away if your eye becomes red, sensitive to light, painful, or watery, or if you have eye bleeding or discharge, a feeling that something is in your eye, or a change or loss of vision several days after you receive this medicine . Also, tell your eye doctor if you feel increased pressure in your eye.

Tell your doctor right away if your implant has moved out of place. You may need a surgery to correct this movement.

Damage to the implant septum (self-sealing part where ranibizumab is given to fill the implant) may occur with Susvimo® . This may cause problems when you receive a refill for your implant. Your doctor may remove the implant or change your treatment if your implant has been damaged.

Tell your doctor that you have Susvimo® implanted in your eye before you have an MRI.

Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until your eye shield can be removed and you can see. Do not rub or touch the area of the eye where the implant is inserted. Wash your hands first, if you have to touch your eye.

This medicine may increase your risk of blood clots, heart attack, or stroke. Check with your doctor right away if you are having pain in your chest, groin, or legs, especially the calves, difficulty or trouble breathing, a severe, sudden headache, slurred speech, sudden loss of coordination, sudden, severe weakness or numbness in your arm or leg, or vision changes.
