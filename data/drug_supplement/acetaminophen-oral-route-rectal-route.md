## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check the progress of you or your child while you are using this medicine . This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to take it.

If your symptoms or fever do not improve within a few days or if they become worse, check with your doctor.

Many combination medicines contain acetaminophen, including products with brand names such as Alka-Seltzer Plus®, Comtrex®, Drixoral®, Excedrin Migraine®, Midol®, Sinutab®, Sudafed®, Theraflu®, and Vanquish®. Adding these medicines to the medicine you already take may cause you to get more than a safe amount of acetaminophen. Talk to your doctor before taking more than one medicine that contains acetaminophen.

Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach; pale stools; dark urine; loss of appetite; nausea; unusual tiredness or weakness; or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.

If you will be taking more than an occasional 1 or 2 doses of acetaminophen, do not drink alcoholic beverages. To do so may increase the chance of liver damage, especially if you drink large amounts of alcohol on a regular basis, if you take more acetaminophen than is recommended on the label, or if you take it regularly for a long time.

Acetaminophen may interfere with the results of some medical tests. Before you have any medical tests, tell the person in charge if you have taken acetaminophen within the past 3 or 4 days. You may also call the laboratory ahead of time to find out whether acetaminophen will cause a problem.

Acetaminophen may cause false results with some blood glucose tests. If you are diabetic and notice a change in your test results, or if you have any questions, check with your doctor.

If you think you have taken too much acetaminophen, get emergency help at once, even if there are no signs of poisoning. Treatment to prevent liver damage must be started as soon as possible.
