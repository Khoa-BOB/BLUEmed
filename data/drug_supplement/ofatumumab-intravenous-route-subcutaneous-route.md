# Ofatumumab (intravenous route, subcutaneous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Arzerra

Kesimpta

## Description

Ofatumumab injection is used in combination with chlorambucil to treat a type of cancer of the white blood cells called chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in patients who have not received any treatments in the past. It is also used in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide to treat patients with relapsed CLL. This medicine is also used in patients with CLL who have already been treated with other medicines (eg, alemtuzumab, fludarabine) that did not work well.

Ofatumumab injection is also used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease. This medicine will not cure MS, but it may slow some of the disabling effects and decrease the number of relapses of the disease.

Ofatumumab interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by ofatumumab, other unwanted effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Some unwanted effects, such as a skin rash, may not be serious but may cause concern. Some of the unwanted effects do not occur until months or years after the medicine is used.

Before you begin treatment with ofatumumab, you and your doctor should talk about the benefits this medicine will do as well as the risks of using it.

Arzerra® is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor. Kesimpta® is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Solution
