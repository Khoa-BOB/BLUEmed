# Empagliflozin (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Jardiance

## Description

Empagliflozin is used to treat type 2 diabetes. It works in the kidneys to prevent absorption of glucose (blood sugar). This helps lower the blood sugar level. Empagliflozin does not help patients who have insulin-dependent or type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetic patients must use insulin injections.

Empagliflozin is also used to lower the risk of cardiovascular death in patients with type 2 diabetes and heart or blood vessel disease. This medicine is also used to lower the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization in patients with heart failure, when the heart cannot pump enough blood to the rest of the body.

Empagliflozin is also used to lower the risk of worsening of kidney disease, end stage kidney disease, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with chronic kidney disease.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
