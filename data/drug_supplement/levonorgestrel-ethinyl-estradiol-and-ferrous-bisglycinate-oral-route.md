## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Balcoltra

## Description

Levonorgestrel, ethinyl estradiol, and ferrous bisglycinate combination is used to prevent pregnancy. It is a birth control pill that contains two types of hormones, levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol, and when taken properly, prevents pregnancy. It works by stopping a woman's egg from fully developing each month. The egg can no longer accept a sperm and fertilization (pregnancy) is prevented.

This medicine also contains ferrous bisglycinate. Ferrous bisglycinate is an iron supplement.

No contraceptive method is 100 percent effective. Birth control methods such as having surgery to become sterile or not having sex are more effective than birth control pills. Discuss your options for birth control with your doctor.

This medicine will not prevent HIV infection or other sexually transmitted diseases. It will not help as emergency contraception, such as after unprotected sexual contact.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
