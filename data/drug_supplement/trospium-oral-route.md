## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of trospium in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.
