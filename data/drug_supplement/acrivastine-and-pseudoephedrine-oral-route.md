# Acrivastine and pseudoephedrine (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Semprex-D

## Description

Acrivastine and pseudoephedrine combination is used to treat an itchy or runny nose, sneezing, or other symptoms caused by seasonal hay fever (allergic rhinitis).

Acrivastine is an antihistamine. It works by preventing the effects of a substance called histamine, which is produced by the body. Histamine can cause itching, sneezing, runny nose, and watery eyes. Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant, which decreases nasal congestion by narrowing the blood vessels and reducing blood flow to the nasal passage.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
