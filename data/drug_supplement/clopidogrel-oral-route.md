# Clopidogrel (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Plavix

## Description

Clopidogrel is used alone or together with aspirin to lessen the chance of a heart attack or stroke. It is given to patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), to patients who have already had a heart attack, severe chest pain, or a stroke, or to patients with other circulation problems (eg, peripheral arterial disease) that could cause a stroke or heart attack. Acute coronary syndrome is a condition where the blood flow to the heart is blocked.

A heart attack or stroke may occur when a blood vessel is blocked by a blood clot. Clopidogrel is a platelet inhibitor. It reduces the chance that a harmful blood clot will form by preventing platelets from clumping together in the blood. Clopidogrel may also increase the chance of serious bleeding in some people.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
