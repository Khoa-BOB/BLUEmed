## Description

Aflibercept injection is used to treat neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD is a disorder of the retina in the eye that causes blurred vision or blindness. Aflibercept works by changing the amount of blood that gets to the retina.

Aflibercept injection is also used to treat macular edema after retinal vein occlusion. It is also used to treat diabetic macular edema (DME) and diabetic retinopathy. Macular edema is swelling in the back of the eye and may cause vision loss. Retinal vein occlusion is a blockage of a blood vessel in the eye. Swelling can occur when the blood vessel is blocked.

Aflibercept injection is also used to treat premature babies with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). ROP happens when abnormal blood vessels grow in the retina.

This medicine is to be given only by your doctor.
