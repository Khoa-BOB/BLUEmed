# Irinotecan liposome (intravenous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Onivyde

## Description

Irinotecan liposome injection is used in combination with other medicines (eg, fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) as first-line treatment of metastatic cancer (a cancer that has already spread) of the pancreas. This medicine is also used in combination with other medicines (eg, fluorouracil, leucovorin) to treat metastatic cancer of the pancreas in patients who have received gemcitabine-based treatment.

Irinotecan liposome belongs to the group of medicines called antineoplastics (cancer medicines). It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal cells may also be affected by the medicine, other effects may also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.
