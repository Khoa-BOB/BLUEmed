# Ticlopidine (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Ticlid

## Description

Ticlopidine is used to lessen the chance of having a stroke. It is given to people who have already had a stroke and to people with certain medical problems that may lead to a stroke. Because ticlopidine can cause serious side effects, especially during the first 3 months of treatment, it is used mostly for people who cannot take aspirin to prevent strokes.

A stroke may occur when blood flow to the brain is interrupted by a blood clot. Ticlopidine reduces the chance that a harmful blood clot will form, by preventing certain cells in the blood from clumping together. This effect of ticlopidine may also increase the chance of serious bleeding in some people.

This medicine is available only with a doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet

### Other Medical Problems

The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:

- Blood clotting problems, such as hemophilia and von Willebrand's disease, or
- Liver disease (severe) or
- Stomach ulcers—The chance of serious bleeding may be increased

- Blood disease—The chance of serious side effects may be increased

- Kidney disease (severe)—Ticlopidine is removed from the body more slowly when the kidneys are not working properly. This may increase the chance of side effects

Also, tell your doctor if you have ever had a problem called thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). This problem could reoccur if you take ticlopidine.

## Proper Use

Ticlopidine should be taken with food. This increases the amount of medicine that is absorbed into the body. It may also lessen the chance of stomach upset.

Take this medicine only as directed by your doctor. Ticlopidine will not work properly if you take less of it than directed. Taking more ticlopidine than directed may increase the chance of serious side effects without increasing the helpful effects.

## Precautions

It is very important that blood tests be done before treatment is started with ticlopidine, and repeated every 2 weeks for the first 3 months of treatment with ticlopidine. The tests are needed to find out whether certain side effects are occurring. Finding these side effects early helps to prevent them from becoming serious. Your doctor will arrange for the blood tests to be done. Be sure that you do not miss any appointments for these tests. You will probably not need to have your blood tested so often after the first 3 months of treatment, because the side effects are less likely to occur after that time.

Tell all medical doctors, dentists, nurses, and pharmacists you go to that you are taking this medicine. Ticlopidine may increase the risk of serious bleeding during an operation or some kinds of dental work. Therefore, treatment may have to be stopped about 10 days to 2 weeks before the operation or dental work is done.

Ticlopidine may cause serious bleeding, especially after an injury. Sometimes, bleeding inside the body can occur without your knowing about it. Ask your doctor whether there are certain activities you should avoid while taking this medicine (for example, sports that can cause injuries). Also, check with your doctor immediately if you are injured while being treated with this medicine.

Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any of the following side effects:

- Bruising or bleeding, especially bleeding that is hard to stop. Bleeding inside the body sometimes appears as bloody or black, tarry stools, or faintness. Also, bleeding may occur from the gums when brushing or flossing teeth.
- Any sign of infection, such as fever, chills, or sore throat.
- Sores, ulcers, or white spots in the mouth.
- Dark or bloody urine, difficulty in speaking, fever, pale color of skin, pinpoint red spots on skin, convulsions (seizures), weakness, or yellow eyes or skin.

After you stop taking ticlopidine, the chance of bleeding may continue for 1 or 2 weeks. During this period of time, continue to follow the same precautions that you followed while you were taking the medicine.
