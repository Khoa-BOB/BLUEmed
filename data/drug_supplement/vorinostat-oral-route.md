# Vorinostat (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Zolinza

## Description

Vorinostat is used to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), a type of cancer that affects certain white blood cells and causes lesions to develop on the skin. This medicine is used when your CTCL gets worse, does not go away, or comes back after you have taken other medicines.

Vorinostat interferes with the growth of the cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by vorinostat, other unwanted effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Some unwanted effects may not be serious but may cause concern. Some of the unwanted effects do not occur until months or years after the medicine is used.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Capsule
