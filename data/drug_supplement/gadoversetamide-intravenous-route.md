# Gadoversetamide (intravenous route)

## Description

Gadoversetamide injection is used to help diagnose or find problems in the brain, spine, head, neck, liver, and other parts of your body. It is a gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Contrast agents are used to help create a clear picture of the different parts of the body during certain medical procedures, such as MRI scans. MRI scans use magnets and computers to create images or “pictures” of certain areas inside the body. Unlike x-rays, they do not involve ionizing radiation.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of gadoversetamide injection in the pediatric population. However, pediatric patients with serious kidney problems may require caution in patients receiving this medicine. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of gadoversetamide injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require caution in patients receiving gadoversetamide.

### Breastfeeding

There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.

### Drug Interactions

Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.

### Other Interactions

Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.  Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur.  Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.

## Proper Use

A doctor or other trained health professional will give you or your child this medicine. It is given through a needle placed into one of your veins just before you have an MRI scan.

This medicine comes with a Medication Guide. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check you or your child's progress while you are receiving this medicine and during the MRI scan to make sure this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

The risk of having a very serious disease called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is increased in patients with severe kidney disease. Even if you have severe kidney problems, your doctor may decide that it is still important to receive this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have burning, itching, swelling, hardening, or tightening of the skin, red or dark patches on the skin, joint stiffness, limited range of motion in the arms and legs, pain that is deep in the hip bone or ribs, or muscle weakness . These may be symptoms of NSF.

This medicine may cause a serious allergic reaction, called anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after using this medicine.

This medicine contains a metal called gadolinium, which can stay in your body (including the brain, bones, skin) for a long time (several months to years). Talk to your doctor if you have concerns.

This medicine may increase your risk of having acute kidney injury requiring dialysis. This is more likely in patients with a history of kidney problems or in patients receiving increasing doses of gadoversetamide injection. Talk to your doctor about this risk.

Before you have any medical tests, tell the medical doctor in charge that you are receiving this medicine. The results of some tests may be affected by this medicine.
