## Description

Factor VIIa is used to treat and prevent bleeding episodes in patients with Hemophilia A or B who have formed antibodies against other clotting proteins (eg, Factor VIII or Factor IX) that help bleeding to stop. It is also used to treat or prevent bleeding in patients with acquired hemophilia, congenital Factor VII deficiency, or Glanzmann's thrombasthenia (a bleeding disorder that is caused by a blood abnormality) that has been treated with platelet transfusions but did not work well.

Factor VIIa is a man-made protein produced to replicate the naturally occurring activated factor VII (factor VIIa) in the body. It is used to stop bleeding of injuries for patients with hemophilia by helping the blood to clot.

Factor VIIa is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Powder for Solution
