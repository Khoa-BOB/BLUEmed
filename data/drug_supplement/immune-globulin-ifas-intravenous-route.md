Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of immune globulin-ifas injection in children 2 years of age and older. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children with ITP or CIDP or in children younger than 2 years of age to treat primary humoral immunodeficiency, congenital agammaglobulinemia, common variable immunodeficiency, X-linked agammaglobulinemia, or Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome .
