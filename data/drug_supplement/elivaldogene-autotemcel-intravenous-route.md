## Description

Elivaldogene autotemcel injection is used to treat early, active cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD) without an available human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donor for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in males 4 to 17 years of age.

Cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene that lead to the buildup of very long fatty acids (VLCFAs) in the brain. These fatty acids may cause brain and nerve damage. The damage can be seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain. Elivaldogene autotemcel injection is recommended if the damage is determined to be early and if the brain disease is active. It will help the body to break down the fatty acids to slow the progression of damage to the brain and slow the decline in nerve function.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Suspension
