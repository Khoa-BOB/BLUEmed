## Description

Anthrax vaccine adsorbed, adjuvanted is used to prevent infection caused by anthrax bacteria. It is used after exposure to anthrax, together with antibiotics, to protect people from getting the disease.

This vaccine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.
