It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed before starting and during treatment with this medicine to check for any unwanted effects.

Receiving this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Use an effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant during treatment with this medicine and for 6 months after the last dose. If you think you have become pregnant while receiving this medicine, tell your doctor right away.

This medicine may cause serious injection reactions, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Check with your doctor right away if you have bleeding, blistering, burning, coldness, discoloration of skin, feeling of pressure, hives, infection, inflammation, itching, lumps, numbness, pain, rash, redness, scarring, soreness, stinging, swelling, tenderness, tingling, ulceration, or warmth at the injection site.

This medicine may increase your risk of developing serious infections (eg, bacterial, fungal, parasitic, viral). Avoid being near people who are sick or have infections while you are using this medicine. Wash your hands often. Also tell your doctor if you have ever had an infection that would not go away or an infection that kept coming back.

Check with your doctor right away if you have ear congestion, chills, cough, chest tightness, fever, sneezing, sore throat, body aches or pain, headache, loss of voice, runny or stuffy nose, unusual tiredness or weakness, or trouble breathing. These could be symptoms of a lung infection.

This medicine may increase your risk for herpes infection. Tell your doctor right away if you have a fever, blistering, burning, crusting, irritation, itching, reddening, stinging, or swelling of the skin, painful cold sores, or blisters on the lips, nose, eyes, genitals, or trunk of the body, skin rash, pain, or itching, changes in vision, confusion, eye pain or redness, headache, or stiff neck.

While you are being treated with ocrelizumab and hyaluronidase-ocsq combination injection, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccinations) without your doctor's approval. You may receive live or live-attenuated vaccines at least 4 weeks or non-live vaccines at least 2 weeks before starting this medicine.

Also, avoid persons who have taken oral polio vaccine within the last several months. Do not get close to them, and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you cannot take these precautions, you should consider wearing a protective face mask that covers the nose and mouth.
