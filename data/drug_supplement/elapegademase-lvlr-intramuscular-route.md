Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.

### Other Interactions

Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.  Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur.  Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.

### Other Medical Problems

The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress closely to make sure this medicine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

Protect yourself or your child from infections until your immune function is improved, usually after 2 to 6 months of treatment. If you can, avoid people with infections.
