## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Multihance

## Description

Gadobenate is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent used to help create a clear picture of the body during MRI scans. MRI scans are a special kind of diagnostic procedure. They use magnets and computers to create images or “pictures” of certain areas inside the body. Unlike x-rays, they do not involve ionizing radiation. Gadobenate is a gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) that is given by injection before an MRI to help diagnose problems in the brain, spine, and other parts of your body.

This medicine is to be used only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of gadobenate injection in the pediatric population. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in preterm babies.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of gadobenate in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving gadobenate.

This medicine should not be given intrathecally (injection given through the spinal canal). It may cause serious unwanted effects including agitation, back pain, blurred vision, change or loss of consciousness, confusion, death, dizziness, drowsiness, fever, hallucinations, headache, irritability, mood or mental changes, seizures, stiff neck, unusual tiredness or weakness, or vomiting when given intrathecally.

These may be symptoms of a very serious disease called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF).
