# Digoxin (intramuscular route, intravenous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Lanoxin

Lanoxin Pediatric

## Description

Digoxin injection is given in combination with a diuretic (water pill) and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor to treat heart failure in adults and children. It is also used to treat adults with atrial fibrillation (a heart rhythm problem).

Digoxin belongs to the class of medicines called cardiac glycosides. It is used to improve the strength and efficiency of the heart, or to control the rate and rhythm of the heartbeat. This leads to better blood circulation and reduced swelling of the hands and ankles in patients with heart problems.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor.

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of digoxin injection to treat atrial fibrillation in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of digoxin injection in children with heart failure. However, infants are more likely to be very sensitive to the effects of digoxin injection which may require an individual dose for infants receiving digoxin injection.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of digoxin injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney or heart problems which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving digoxin injection.

### Breastfeeding

Studies in women suggest that this medication poses minimal risk to the infant when used during breastfeeding.
