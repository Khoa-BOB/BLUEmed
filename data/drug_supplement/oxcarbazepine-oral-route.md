## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of oxcarbazepine suspension or tablets alone in children 4 years of age and older. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 4 years of age.

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of oxcarbazepine suspension or tablets together with other medicines in children 2 years of age and older. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 2 years of age.

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of oxcarbazepine extended-release tablets in children 6 years of age and older. However, use of the extended-release tablets is not recommended in children younger than 6 years of age.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of oxcarbazepine in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving oxcarbazepine.
