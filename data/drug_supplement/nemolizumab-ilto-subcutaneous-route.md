## Proper Use

A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine. It is given as a shot under your skin, usually in the thigh, stomach area, or upper arm. This medicine may also be given at home to patients who do not need to be in a hospital or clinic. You or your caregiver may be trained to prepare and inject the medicine at home. Be sure that you understand how to use the medicine.

This medicine should come with a patient information leaflet and patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.

If you use Nemluvio® at home, you will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. This will help prevent skin problems. Do not inject into skin areas that are tender, bruised, red, or areas with scars or stretch marks.

Allow the medicine to warm to room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes before using it. Do not warm it using any heat source (eg, microwave, sunlight).

Do not use the pen if it is broken, cracked, or damaged, or if it has been dropped.

To use:

- Wash your hands with soap and water before and after using this medicine.
- Hold the pen upright and turn the activation knob to the right until it stops. Wait until the gray rod stops moving. When the gray rod has completely stopped, shake the pen up and down for 30 seconds.
- Wait for 5 minutes for the bubbles to decrease and the powder to dissolve completely.
- Check the liquid in the prefilled pen. It should be clear and colorless to slightly yellow. Do not use it if it is cloudy, discolored, or has particles in it.
- Hold the pen upright. Twist the gray cap until the orange needle guard appears. Gently pull the cap off.
- Place the pen vertically so that the orange needle guard is flat against the skin. Gently push the pen down until the orange needle guard is completely pushed in. Hold for 15 seconds. Check the inspection window to make sure the orange rod and gray rod have stopped.
- Lift the pen straight up from your skin. The orange needle guard locks into place to cover the needle.
