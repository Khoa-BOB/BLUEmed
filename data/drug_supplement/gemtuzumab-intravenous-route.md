# Gemtuzumab (intravenous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Mylotarg

## Description

Gemtuzumab injection is used alone or together with other medicines (eg, cytarabine, daunorubicin) to treat newly-diagnosed CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in adults. It is also used alone to treat CD33-positive AML that has come back (relapsed) or after other medicines did not work well (refractory).

Gemtuzumab is an antineoplastic (cancer) medicine. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal cells may also be affected by gemtuzumab, other side effects can occur. Before you begin treatment, talk to your doctor about the benefits of this medicine as well as the possible risks of using it.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
