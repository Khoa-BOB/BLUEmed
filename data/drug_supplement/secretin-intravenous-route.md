## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly and to check for unwanted effects.

Do not also use stomach medicines, such as a proton pump inhibitor and an H2 blocker together with secretin injection. This may cause an increase in the response to pancreas stimulation testing, which may lead to a false diagnosis of having gastrinoma (tumor in the bowel or pancreas).
