# Propafenone (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Rythmol

Rythmol SR

## Description

Propafenone is used to prevent irregular heartbeats such as atrial fibrillation (AF) from occurring again in patients who do not have structural heart disease.

Propafenone belongs to the group of medicines known as antiarrhythmics. It works directly on the heart tissue and will slow the nerve impulses in the heart. This helps keep the heart rhythm normal.

There is a chance that propafenone may cause new or make worse existing heart rhythm problems when it is used. Since it has been shown to cause severe problems in some patients, propafenone is only used to treat serious heart rhythm problems. Discuss this possible effect with your doctor.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Capsule, Extended Release
- Tablet
