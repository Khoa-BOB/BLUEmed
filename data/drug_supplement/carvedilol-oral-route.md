## Description

Carvedilol is used alone or together with other medicines to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure may reduce the risk of stroke and heart attacks.

Carvedilol is also used to prevent further worsening of congestive heart failure. It is also used to treat left ventricular dysfunction after a heart attack. Left ventricular dysfunction occurs when the left ventricle (the main pumping chamber of the heart) stiffens and enlarges and can cause the lungs to fill with blood.

This medicine is a beta-blocker. It works by affecting the response to nerve impulses in certain parts of the body, like the heart. As a result, the heart beats slower and decreases the blood pressure. When the blood pressure is lowered, the amount of blood and oxygen is increased to the heart.

Carvedilol may also be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
- Capsule, Extended Release

This medicine may worsen the symptoms of heart failure in some patients. Check with your doctor right away if you are having chest pain or discomfort, dilated neck veins, irregular breathing or heartbeat, swelling of the face, fingers, feet, or lower legs, trouble breathing, unusual tiredness or weakness, or weight gain.

- Check with your doctor if you have unexplained weight gain or increased trouble breathing. These may be signs of a worsening of your condition.

For patients who wear contact lenses:

- Carvedilol may cause your eyes to form tears less than they do normally. Check with your doctor if you have dry eyes.
