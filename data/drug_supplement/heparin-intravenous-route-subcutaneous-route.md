# Heparin (intravenous route, subcutaneous route)

## Description

Heparin injection is an anticoagulant. It is used to decrease the clotting ability of the blood and help prevent harmful clots from forming in blood vessels. This medicine is sometimes called a blood thinner, although it does not actually thin the blood. Heparin will not dissolve blood clots that have already formed, but it may prevent the clots from becoming larger and causing more serious problems.

Heparin is used to prevent or treat certain blood vessel, heart, and lung conditions. Heparin is also used to prevent blood clotting during open-heart surgery, bypass surgery, kidney dialysis, and blood transfusions. It is used in low doses to prevent the formation of blood clots in certain patients, especially those who must have certain types of surgery or who must remain in bed for a long time. Heparin may also be used to diagnose and treat a serious blood condition called disseminated intravascular coagulation.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Solution

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of heparin injection in children. However, because heparin contains benzyl alcohol, use in newborn babies is not recommended.

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of heparin injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to develop bleeding problems, which may require an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving heparin injection.

Studies in women suggest that this medication poses minimal risk to the infant when used during breastfeeding.

Use this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor . Do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered.

You will be shown the body areas where the shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. This will help prevent skin problems from the shots.

If you are using the medicine at home, blood tests will be needed to check for unwanted effects. Be sure to keep all appointments.

Do not take aspirin, ibuprofen, or other anti-inflammatory medicines (eg, NSAIDs) while you are using heparin. Many nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and some prescription medicines contain these ingredients. Check the labels of all medicines you take. There are many other medicines that may change the way heparin works or increase the chance of bleeding if they are used together with heparin. It is best to check with your doctor before taking any other medicine while you are using heparin.

You may bleed and bruise more easily while you are using this medicine. Stay away from rough sports or other situations where you could be bruised, cut, or injured. Tell your doctor about any falls, blows to the body or head, or other injuries, since serious bleeding may occur inside the body with this medicine. Be careful when using sharp objects, including razors and fingernail clippers. Avoid picking your nose. If you need to blow your nose, blow it gently. Check with your doctor right away if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising; black, tarry stools; blood in the urine or stools; or pinpoint red spots on your skin.

Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.

This medicine may cause a serious type of allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash; itching; swelling of the face, tongue, and throat; trouble breathing; or chest pain after you receive this medicine.

This medicine may cause new blood clots to form in some people while they are receiving the medicine or after it is stopped. Stop using this medicine and check with your doctor right away if you have pain in the chest, groin, or legs, especially the calves; difficulty with breathing; a sudden, severe headache; slurred speech; a sudden, unexplained shortness of breath; a sudden loss of coordination; or vision changes while using this medicine.
