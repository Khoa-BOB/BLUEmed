# Aliskiren (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Tekturna

## Description

Aliskiren is used alone or together with other medicines to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure will reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks.

Aliskiren is a renin inhibitor. It works by blocking an enzyme in the body that is necessary to produce a substance that causes blood vessels to tighten. As a result, the blood vessels relax and this decreases the blood pressure. When the blood pressure is lowered, the amount of blood and oxygen that go to the heart is increased.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
