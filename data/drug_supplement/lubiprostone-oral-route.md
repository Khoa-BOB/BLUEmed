## Description

Lubiprostone is used to treat long-lasting constipation in adults. It is also used to treat constipation caused by opioids (narcotic pain medicines) in adults with long-lasting pain that is not caused by cancer, or in patients with long-lasting pain caused by a previous cancer or its treatment who do not need weekly increases in opioid dosage. This medicine works by increasing the fluid secretion of the bowels, which helps ease the passage of stool and helps relieve the symptoms associated with constipation.

Lubiprostone is also used to treat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in women who have constipation as the main symptom.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
