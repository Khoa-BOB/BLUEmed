## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Lumason

## Description

Sulfur hexafluoride lipid type A microspheres injection is used during an echocardiogram to help diagnose or find problems in the heart. It is also used to help diagnose or find problems in the liver or urinary tract.

Sulfur hexafluoride lipid type A microspheres is an ultrasound contrast agent. Ultrasound contrast agents are used to help provide a clear picture during ultrasound. Ultrasound is a special kind of diagnostic procedure. It uses high-frequency sound waves to create images or “pictures” of certain areas inside the body. The sound waves produced by the ultrasound equipment can be reflected (bounced off) by different parts of the body, such as the heart or liver. As the sound waves return they are electronically converted into images on a television screen. Unlike x-rays, ultrasound does not involve ionizing radiation. The lipid microspheres sonicated preparation contains very small gas-filled lipid microspheres that reflect the sound waves and help create a better picture.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor with specialized training in ultrasound procedures.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Powder for Suspension
