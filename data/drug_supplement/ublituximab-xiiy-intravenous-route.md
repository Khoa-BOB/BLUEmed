Call your doctor or pharmacist for instructions.

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed before starting and during treatment with this medicine to check for any unwanted effects.

Receiving this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. If you are a woman who can get pregnant, your doctor may do tests to make sure you are not pregnant before receiving this medicine. Use an effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant during treatment with this medicine and for 6 months after the last dose. If you think you have become pregnant while receiving this medicine, tell your doctor right away.

This medicine may cause infusion reaction, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you start to have chest tightness, chills, cough, difficulty swallowing, dizziness, fever, headache, nausea, fast, pounding, or irregular heartbeat or pulse, lightheadedness or faintness, puffiness or swelling of the eyelids or around the eyes, face, lips, or tongue, sore throat, swelling in your face or hands, skin itching, redness, rash, or hives, trouble breathing, or unusual tiredness or weakness while you are receiving this medicine.

This medicine may increase your risk of developing infections. Avoid being near people who are sick or have infections while you are using this medicine. Wash your hands often. Also tell your doctor if you have ever had an infection that would not go away or an infection that kept coming back.

This medicine may cause hepatitis B virus reactivation and liver injury. Tell your doctor right away if you have yellow skin or eyes, dark brown-colored urine, right-sided stomach pain, fever, or severe tiredness.

This medicine may increase your risk of developing infections, including a rare and serious brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). This is more likely to occur if you have JCV infection. Check with your doctor if you have weakness on one side of the body, clumsiness, blurred vision, changes in thinking, memory problems, confusion, or personality changes.

While you are being treated with ublituximab-xiiy, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccinations) without your doctor's approval. Complete any required live or live-attenuated vaccines at least 4 weeks, or non-live vaccines at least 2 weeks, before starting this medicine. This medicine may lower your body's resistance and there is a chance you might get the infection the immunization is meant to prevent. In addition, other persons living in your household should not take oral polio vaccine since there is a chance they could pass the polio virus on to you. Also, avoid persons who have taken oral polio vaccine within the last several months. Do not get close to them, and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you cannot take these precautions, you should consider wearing a protective face mask that covers the nose and mouth.

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
