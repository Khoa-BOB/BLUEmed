# Minocycline (subgingival route)

## Description

Minocycline is used to help treat periodontal disease (a disease of your gums). Periodontal disease is caused by bacteria growing beneath the gum line. Minocycline works by keeping the number of bacteria from growing. Lowering the amount of bacteria helps to reduce inflammation and swelling in your mouth, and the amount of bleeding around the teeth. Minocycline is placed in deep gum pockets next to your teeth in order to reduce the depth of the pockets.

This medicine will be applied by your dentist or other oral health care professional.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Powder

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Use is not recommended in infants and children up to 8 years of age. Tetracyclines, such as minocycline, may cause permanent discoloration of teeth and slow down the growth of bones. The safety and effectiveness of minocycline have not been determined in children 8 years of age or older.

### Geriatric

Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing use of minocycline in the elderly with use in other age groups.

### Breastfeeding

There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.

## Proper Use

The amount of medicine that is put into your gum pockets will be determined by your dentist. The number of teeth that need treatment and the depth of the pockets will determine the amount of medicine that is used.

After the medicine is placed in your mouth, try to avoid any actions that may cause the medicine to come out. For example:

- Do not chew hard, crunchy, or sticky foods for 1 week after treatment.
- Do not brush near any treated areas. Wait 12 hours after the procedure before brushing the other teeth.
- Do not use dental floss or any other cleaning tools that go between the teeth for 10 days after treatment.
- Do not probe or pick at the treated areas with your tongue, toothpicks, or fingers.

## Precautions

Check with your dentist as soon as possible if you have pain or swelling or other problems in the treated areas.

It is very important that your dentist check your progress. Do not miss any dental appointments.

Tetracyclines, such as minocycline, may cause your skin to be more sensitive to sunlight than normal. Exposure to sunlight, even for brief periods of time, may cause a skin rash, itching, redness or other discoloration of the skin, or a severe sunburn. After receiving minocycline:

- Stay out of direct sunlight, especially between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., if possible.
- Wear protective clothing, including a hat. Also, wear sunglasses.
- Apply a sun block product that has a skin protection factor (SPF) of at least 15. Some patients may require a product with a higher SPF number, especially if they have a fair complexion. If you have any questions about this, check with your health care professional.
- Apply a sun block lip balm or lipstick that has an SPF of at least 15 to protect your lips.
- Do not use a sunlamp or tanning bed or booth.

If you have a severe reaction from the sun, check with your dentist or doctor.
