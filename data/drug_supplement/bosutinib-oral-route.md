# Bosutinib (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Bosulif

## Description

Bosutinib is used to treat chronic phase (CP) Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (Ph+ CML) in patients who are newly-diagnosed or who have taken other medicines that did not work well. This medicine is also used to treat accelerated phase (AP) or blast phase (BP) Ph+ CML in patients who have taken other medicines but did not work well. Leukemia is a type of cancer where the body makes abnormal white blood cells.

Bosutinib is an antineoplastic (cancer) medicine. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal cells may also be affected by bosutinib, other side effects can occur. Before you begin treatment, talk to your doctor about the benefits of this medicine as well as the possible risks of using it.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Capsule
- Tablet

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

Bosutinib can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:

- If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor right away if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.
- Check with your doctor right away if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.
- Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.
- Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.
- Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.
- Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.

Check with your doctor right away if you are rapidly gaining weight, having chest pain, extreme tiredness or weakness, irregular breathing, irregular heartbeat, or excessive swelling of the face, hands, wrist, ankles, or feet. These may be symptoms of fluid retention (too much water in your body).

Check with your doctor right away if you have stomach pain, pale stools or dark urine, loss of appetite, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.

Check with your doctor right away if you have chest pain or tightness, decreased urine output, dilated neck veins, extreme fatigue, irregular breathing, irregular heartbeat, swelling of the face, fingers, feet, or lower legs, trouble breathing, weight gain. These could be symptoms of a serious heart problem.

This medicine may cause serious kidney problem. Check with your doctor right away if you have agitation, coma, confusion, decreased urine output, depression, dizziness, headache, hostility, irritability, lethargy, muscle twitching, nausea, rapid weight gain, seizures, stupor, swelling of the face, ankles, or hands, or unusual tiredness or weakness.

Cancer medicines can cause diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or stomach pain, even after receiving medicines to prevent it. Ask your doctor or nurse about ways to control these side effects.
