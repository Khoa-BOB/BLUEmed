Icodextrin may cause an infection in the peritoneal cavity called peritonitis. This is common in patients on peritoneal dialysis. Tell your doctor if you have pain, redness, fever, or cloudy drained fluid.

Icodextrin may cause serious allergic and skin reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, serum sickness, and vasculitis, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, chills, cough, diarrhea, itching, joint or muscle pain, large, hive-like swelling on the face, eyelids, lips, tongue, throat, hands, legs, feet, or sex organs, red irritated eyes, red skin lesions, often with a purple center, sore throat, sores, ulcers, or white spots in the mouth or on the lips, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are using this medicine.

It is important for you to keep track of how much fluid you have in your body at all times. Ask your healthcare provider about how to do this, and what to do if you have too much or too little fluid. One way to keep track of how much fluid is in your body is to weigh yourself often, and write the number down.

Tell your doctor about all other medicines you are using. Icodextrin might remove some medicines from your body, so your doctor might need to change your dose of other medicines. Do not change the dose of any of your other medicines unless your doctor tells you to.
