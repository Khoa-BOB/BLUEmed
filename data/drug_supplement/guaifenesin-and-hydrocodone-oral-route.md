## Description

Guaifenesin and hydrocodone combination is used to treat cough and to loosen mucus associated with the common cold.

Hydrocodone is an opioid antitussive (cough suppressant). It acts directly on the cough center in the brain to relieve cough. Guaifenesin is used to help clear mucus or phlegm from the chest when you have congestion from a cold or flu. It works by thinning the mucus or phlegm in the lungs.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

Naloxone is a medicine that temporarily reverses the effects of an overdose. If you have been prescribed naloxone, make sure household members know how to use this on you in the event of an overdose or suspected overdose. Emergency medical attention is still needed after naloxone is used because the reversal effects are only temporary.
