### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Drug Interactions

Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.

### Other Interactions

Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.  Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur.  Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.

## Proper Use

Your doctor will give you this medicine through a needle into your retina (part of the eye). It is to be injected into each eye separately at least 6 days apart.

You may be given an oral steroid medicine before, during, and after treatment with voretigene neparvovec-rzyl in the first eye and to be repeated with treatment of your other eye.

This medicine may cause air bubbles to form inside the eye. Avoid air travel, traveling to places with high elevations, or scuba diving for at least 1 week.

Retinal problems (eg, a tear or hole, bleeding) may occur with this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you see floaters or light flashes in your line of vision, decreased vision, or any other change in vision.

This medicine may increase your risk of cataracts and cause an increase of pressure in the eyes. Check with your doctor if you have blindness, blurred vision, or decreased vision.

Be careful when handling your clothes or other materials that have been wet by your tears or nose secretions. This medicine may still be present for up to 7 days after treatment.
