## Before Using

In deciding to use a diagnostic test, any risks of the test must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. Also, other things may affect test results. For this test, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

No information is available on whether the risk of arginine-induced adverse effects is increased in children. However, because of this medication's toxicity, it should be used with extreme caution. Recommended doses should not be exceeded, and the patient should be carefully monitored during treatment.

### Geriatric

Although appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of arginine injection have not been performed in the geriatric population, no geriatric-specific problems have been documented to date.

### Breastfeeding

There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.

### Drug Interactions

Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving this diagnostic test, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.

Receiving this diagnostic test with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.

- Amiloride
- Spironolactone
- Triamterene

### Other Interactions

Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.  Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur.  Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.

### Other Medical Problems

The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this diagnostic test. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:

- Electrolyte imbalance—Should be corrected first before receiving this medicine.

- Kidney disease—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of the slower removal of the medicine from the body.

## Proper Use

A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine. It is given through a needle placed into one of your veins. It must be given slowly, so the needle must stay in place for at least 30 minutes.

The test is usually given in the morning, after at least 30 minutes of bed rest. You will be advised not to take any food or water the night before the test and during the test procedure. Care should be taken to lessen nervousness and distress, especially in children.

You may have to repeat this test 1 day after the results of the first one showed a deficiency in the function of your pituitary gland.

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check you closely to make sure that this medicine is working properly and to check for unwanted effects.

Your growth hormone levels are normally increased when you are pregnant or taking birth control pills, which can affect the result of the test procedure. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about this before receiving this medicine.
