# Arsenic trioxide (intravenous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Trisenox

## Description

Arsenic trioxide injection is used together with another medicine (eg, tretinoin) to treat newly-diagnosed low-risk acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a type of leukemia (cancer of the blood cells). It is also used to treat APL in patients who have not responded to other medication regimens. It may also be used to treat other kinds of cancer, as determined by your doctor.

Arsenic trioxide belongs to the general group of medicines called antineoplastics. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by arsenic trioxide, other unwanted effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor.

Before you begin treatment with arsenic trioxide injection, you and your doctor should talk about the benefits of this medicine as well as the risks of using it.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Solution

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check you or your child's progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

You should not receive this medicine if you are pregnant. Using this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Use an effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant during treatment with this medicine and for 6 months after the last dose. Male patients with female partners should use an effective form of birth control during treatment with this medicine and for 3 months after the last dose. If you think you or your sexual partner have become pregnant while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away.

If you plan to have children, talk with your doctor before using this medicine. Some men using this medicine have become infertile (unable to have children).

Tell your doctor right away if you have chest pain or discomfort, chills, cough, difficulty with breathing, eye pain, fever, general feeling of illness, headache, sore throat, unusual tiredness or weakness, or weight gain while using this medicine. These may be symptoms of a serious condition called retinoic-acid-APL (RA-APL) or APL differentiation syndrome.

This medicine can cause serious heart rhythm problems, including arrhythmias. Your doctor will monitor you during treatment to assess for heart rhythm problems. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about this.

This medicine may cause a brain disease called encephalopathy. It may also increase your risk for Wernicke’s encephalopathy, especially if you have vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency. This is more likely in patients who have been drinking alcohol for a long time, who also use a diuretic (eg, furosemide), or who have malabsorption and nutritional deficiency. Check with your doctor right away if you have blurred vision, loss of consciousness, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, fever, hallucinations, headache, irritability, mood or mental changes, seizures, a stiff neck, unusual tiredness or weakness, or vomiting.

Check with your doctor right away if you have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.
