# Amylase/lipase/pancrelipase/protease (oral route)

## Description

Pancrelipase is used to treat patients who cannot digest food normally because their pancreas does not make enough enzymes (exocrine pancreatic insufficiency). Pancrelipase tablet is used in combination with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) in patients who have long-term swelling of the pancreas (chronic pancreatitis) or who have had some or all of their pancreas removed (pancreatectomy).

Pancrelipase contains a mixture of digestive enzymes (eg, lipases, proteases, and amylases) needed for the digestion of proteins, starches, and fats.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

Take this medicine with food.

Swallow the capsule or tablet whole with enough fluid (eg, water or juice) to prevent irritation of the mouth. Do not crush or chew it.

For patients taking the tablets :

- Viokace™ tablet is used in combination with certain medicines for stomach ulcer called proton pump inhibitors (eg, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, Nexium®, Prevacid®, Prilosec®).
- Swallow the tablets quickly with some liquid, without chewing, to avoid mouth irritation.

For patients taking the delayed-release capsules :

- Swallow the capsule whole.
- Do not crush, break, or chew before swallowing. Do not hold the capsule in your mouth.
- When given to adults or children who can not swallow the capsule, the capsule may be opened and sprinkled onto a small amount (about 10 mL or less) of soft acidic food (eg, applesauce, bananas, or plain Greek yogurt). Mix the contents evenly. Do not crush the capsule contents while mixing. This mixture must be swallowed immediately and followed with a glass of water or juice. This will ensure complete swallowing of the contents of the capsule and avoid mouth irritation.
- When given to infants, the contents of the capsule may be put directly into the infant's mouth or mixed with a small amount (about 10 mL or less) of soft acidic food (eg, applesauce, pureed bananas, or pears), followed by 4 ounces (120 mL) of formula or breastfeeding. Do not mix the contents of the capsule directly into a bottle of breast milk or formula. This could reduce the effect of the medicine.
- Pertzye® capsules may also be given through a gastrostomy tube with a diameter of 14 French or larger. Mix the contents of the capsule with soft food (eg, applesauce). Remove the plunger and carefully spoon the mixture into the syringe. Replace the plunger partially back. Connect the syringe into the tube feeding port and inject the medicine for 10 to 12 seconds. Flush the tube with 10 mL of water to rinse all of the medicine into the stomach.
