# Methotrexate (injection route, subcutaneous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Otrexup

Rasuvo

RediTrex

## Description

Methotrexate injection is used alone or together with other medicines to treat several types of cancer, such as breast, head and neck, lung, blood, bone, lymph node, and uterus cancers.

Methotrexate is also used to treat severe rheumatoid arthritis in adults and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children who had other treatments that did not work well. It is also used to control symptoms of severe psoriasis in adults who have not been helped by other treatments.

Methotrexate belongs to the group of medicines known as antineoplastics (cancer medicines). It blocks an enzyme that is needed by cells to live. This interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. For patients with arthritis or psoriasis, methotrexate may work by improving the immune system.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Solution
- Powder for Solution

It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:

- Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.

- Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.

In addition, you should not be around other persons living in your household who receive live virus vaccines because there is a chance they could pass the virus on to you. Some examples of live vaccines include measles, mumps, influenza (nasal flu vaccine), poliovirus (oral form), rotavirus, and rubella.
