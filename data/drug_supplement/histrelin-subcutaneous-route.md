# Histrelin (subcutaneous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Supprelin LA

Vantas

## Description

Histrelin is a synthetic (man-made) hormone that is similar to a natural hormone that is produced in the brain. This medicine works in the brain to reduce the blood levels of sex hormones, such as testosterone and estrogen. It is inserted just beneath the skin of the upper arm where it releases small amounts of histrelin in the body every day for 12 months.

Histrelin ( Vantas® ) is used to treat advanced prostate cancer in adults. It will reduce the level of testosterone, a male hormone, in the blood. Testosterone makes most prostate cancers grow. Histrelin is not a cure for prostate cancer, but it may help relieve the symptoms.

Histrelin ( Supprelin® LA ) is used to treat central precocious puberty (CPP) in children. CPP is a condition wherein puberty begins at an unusually early age. This usually means puberty occurs before 8 years of age in girls and before 9 years of age in boys.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a trained healthcare professional.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Implant

## Proper Use

A doctor or other trained health professional will give you this medicine. The histrelin implant will be placed under the skin in the inner area of the upper arm.

Your doctor will treat the upper arm with a numbing medicine (anesthetic) and then cut a small incision to insert the implant. The incision will be closed with either stitches or surgical strips. A pressure bandage will be placed over the arm and left in place for 24 hours.

Do not remove the surgical strips. Allow them to fall off on their own after several days. If the incision has been stitched, your doctor will remove the stitches or they will dissolve after several days.

After the implant is inserted, you should keep the arm clean and dry. Do not swim or bathe for 24 hours. You should avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous exercise for the first 7 days after the implant is inserted.

The implant will be left in place for one year (12 months) and then removed. If needed, your doctor will insert a new implant to continue treatment for another year.
