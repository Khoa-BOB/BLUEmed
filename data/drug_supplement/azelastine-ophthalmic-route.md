- If you think you did not get the drop of medicine into your eye properly, use another drop.
- Immediately after using the eye drops, wash your hands to remove any medicine that may be on them.

To keep the medicine as germ-free as possible, do not touch the applicator tip to any surface (including the eye). Also, keep the container tightly closed. Serious damage to the eye and possible loss of vision may result from using contaminated eye drops.
