# Carbidopa and levodopa (route not applicable)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Duopa

## Description

Carbidopa and levodopa enteral suspension is used to treat motor fluctuations in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is a disorder of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).

Dopamine is a naturally occurring substance in the brain that helps provide control of movement and activities such as walking and talking. In patients with Parkinson's disease, there is not enough dopamine in some parts of the brain. Levodopa enters the brain and helps replace the missing dopamine, which allows people to function better. By increasing the amount of dopamine in the brain, levodopa helps control symptoms and helps you to perform daily activities such as dressing, walking, and handling utensils.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Suspension

Duopa® comes in a small, plastic container called cassette. This medicine is given continuously for 16 hours through a tube that is put into your stomach called a PEG-J. A small portable pump (CADD-Legacy 1400) is used to move Duopa® from the cassette through your PEG-J tube. It may also be given for a short time using a tube through your nose called a naso-jejunal (NJ) tube. Your doctor will show you how to use Duopa® and the portable pump before you use it for the first time.

Before using this medicine, your doctor will need to have a procedure to make a small hole in your stomach to place the PEG-J tube. Your doctor will need to ask you if you have had stomach surgery or problems with your stomach before starting this medicine.

Your prescribed dose of Duopa® will be programmed into your pump by your doctor. Your Duopa® dose should only be changed by your doctor.

Keep a supply of carbidopa-levodopa immediate release tablets in case you are not able to get your Duopa® infusion. You will also need these tablets for your prescribed night-time dose after receiving your Duopa® dose.

Since protein may interfere with the body's response to carbidopa and levodopa, high protein diets should be avoided. Intake of normal amounts of protein should be spaced equally throughout the day, or taken as directed by your doctor.
