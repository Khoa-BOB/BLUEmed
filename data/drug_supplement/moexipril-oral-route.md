# Moexipril (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Univasc

## Description

Moexipril is used alone or together with other medicines to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of strokes and heart attacks.

Moexipril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. It works by blocking a substance in the body that causes blood vessels to tighten. As a result, moexipril relaxes the blood vessels. This lowers blood pressure and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
