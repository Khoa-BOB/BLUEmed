# Oliceridine (intravenous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Olinvyk

## Description

Oliceridine injection is used to relieve acute pain severe enough to require a narcotic pain medicine and in patients who have been previously treated with other medicines that did not work well.

Oliceridine belongs to the group of medicines called narcotic analgesics (pain medicines). It acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain.

When oliceridine is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Solution
