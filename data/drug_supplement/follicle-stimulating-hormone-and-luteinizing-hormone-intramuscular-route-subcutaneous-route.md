## Description

Menotropins injection is used to treat infertility in women. Menotropins are a mixture of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) that are produced in the body by the pituitary gland.

Menotropins injection is used in women with healthy ovaries who are enrolled in a fertility program called assisted reproductive technology (ART). ART uses procedures such as in vitro fertilization (IVF). Menotropins is used together with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in these procedures.

Many women choosing treatment with menotropins have already tried clomiphene (eg, Serophene) and have not been able to conceive yet. Menotropins may also be used to cause the ovary to produce several follicles, which can then be harvested for use in gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) or in vitro fertilization (IVF).

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
