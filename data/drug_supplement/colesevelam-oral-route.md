# Colesevelam (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Welchol

## Description

Colesevelam is used together with proper diet and exercise to lower high cholesterol levels in the blood. This may help prevent medical problems caused by cholesterol clogging the blood vessels. It is also used to lower high blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Colesevelam works by attaching to food substances in the intestines (bowels). This medicine is not absorbed from the intestines, so these substances pass out of the body without being absorbed.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
- Powder for Suspension

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of colesevelam to lower high cholesterol levels in the blood in boys and in girls who have had their first menstrual period 10 years of age and older. However, safety and efficacy have not been established to lower high cholesterol levels in the blood in children younger than 10 years of age or in girls before having their first menstrual period and to lower high blood sugar levels in children with type 2 diabetes.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of colesevelam in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of this medicine than younger adults.
