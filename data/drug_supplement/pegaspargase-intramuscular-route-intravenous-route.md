# Pegaspargase (intramuscular route, intravenous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Oncaspar

## Description

Pegaspargase injection is used in combination with other cancer medicines to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a type of blood cancer that affects the white blood cells. It is also used to treat ALL in patients who have had serious allergic reactions to L-asparaginase treatments. Pegaspargase belongs to the group of medicines called antineoplastics.

Pegaspargase interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal body cells also may be affected by pegaspargase, other effects may also occur. Some of these effects may be serious and must be reported to your doctor.

Before you begin treatment with pegaspargase, you and your doctor should talk about the benefits as well as the risks of using it.

Pegaspargase is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

Use another form of birth control (eg, condoms, spermicide) along with your pills during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose. If you think you have become pregnant while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away.
