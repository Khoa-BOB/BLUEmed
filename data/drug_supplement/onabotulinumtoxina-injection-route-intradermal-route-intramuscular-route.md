## Description

OnabotulinumtoxinA is used to treat certain eye conditions, such as blepharospasm (a condition where the eyelid will not stay open because of a muscle spasm) or strabismus (a condition where the eyes do not line up properly).

OnabotulinumtoxinA is also used to treat the abnormal head position and neck pain that result from cervical dystonia (severe muscle spasms of the neck) and some types of axillary hyperhidrosis (severe sweating of the armpits).

OnabotulinumtoxinA is used to treat increased muscle stiffness in the elbow, wrist, and finger muscles or ankle and toe muscles in adults with upper or lower limb spasticity or in children 2 to 17 years of age with upper and lower limb spasticity.

OnabotulinumtoxinA is also used to prevent headaches in patients with chronic migraine (severe headaches for 15 or more days a month lasting 4 or more hours a day).

OnabotulinumtoxinA is used cosmetically to temporarily improve the appearance of moderate to severe frown lines between the eyebrows (glabellar lines), forehead lines, crow's feet lines (lateral canthal lines), and vertical bands connecting the jaw and neck (platysma bands).

OnabotulinumtoxinA is also used to treat urinary incontinence (loss of bladder control) in patients with an overactive bladder caused by nervous system disorders (eg, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury). It is also used to treat an overactive bladder caused by a nervous system disorder or overactive bladder with symptoms, such as loss of bladder control, increased urge to urinate, and frequent need to urinate in patients who have failed treatment with other medicines (eg, anticholinergics).

OnabotulinumtoxinA is a botulinum toxin A product. It works on the nervous system to relax the muscles.

OnabotulinumtoxinA is injected into the affected muscles. Depending on your condition, more than one treatment may be required.
