Regitine

## Description

Phentolamine given by injection causes blood vessels to expand, thereby increasing blood flow. When injected into the penis (intracavernosal), it increases blood flow to the penis, which results in an erection.

This medicine should not be used as a sexual aid by men who do not have erectile dysfunction. If the medicine is not used properly, permanent damage to the penis and loss of the ability to have erections could result.

Phentolamine may also be used to reverse the effects of an anesthetic medicine in soft tissues, such as the lips and tongue. It may be used to help quickly restore normal sensation and function in patients who have received local dental anesthesia .

Phentolamine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Powder for Solution

### Other Medical Problems

The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:

- Sickle cell disease—Patients with these conditions have an increased risk of priapism (erection lasting longer than 4 hours) while using phentolamine.

## Proper Use

To give the injection:

- Cleanse the injection site with alcohol. Using a sterile needle, inject the medicine slowly and directly into the base of the penis as instructed by your doctor. It should not be injected just under the skin. The injection is usually not painful, although you may feel some tingling in the tip of your penis. If the injection is very painful or you notice bruising or swelling at the place of injection, that means you are injecting the medicine under the skin. Stop, withdraw the needle, and reposition it properly before continuing with the injection.
- After you have completed the injection, put pressure on the place of injection to prevent bruising. Then massage your penis as instructed by your doctor. This helps the medicine spread to all parts of the penis, so that it will work better.

This medicine usually begins to work in about 10 minutes. You should attempt intercourse within 2 hours after injecting the medicine.

To reverse the effects of a soft-tissue anesthetic medicine, a dentist or other trained health professional will give you this medicine. This medicine is usually injected at the same spot where you have received the local dental anesthesia .

## Precautions

Use the injection exactly as directed by your doctor. Do not use more of it and do not use it more often than ordered. If too much is used, the erection may become so strong that it lasts too long and does not reverse when it should. This condition is called priapism, and it can be very dangerous. If the effect is not reversed, the blood supply to the penis may be cut off and permanent damage may occur.

Contact your doctor immediately if the erection lasts for longer than 4 hours or if it becomes painful. This may be a sign of priapism and must be treated right away to prevent permanent damage.

If you notice bleeding at the site when you inject the medicine, put pressure on the spot until the bleeding stops. If it doesn't stop, check with your doctor.

It is important for you to examine your penis regularly. Check with your doctor if you find a lump where the medicine has been injected or if you notice that your penis is becoming curved. These may be signs that unwanted tissue is growing (called fibrosis), which should be seen by your doctor.
