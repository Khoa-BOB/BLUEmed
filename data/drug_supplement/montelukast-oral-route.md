You may be taking other medicines for asthma together with montelukast. Do not stop taking these medicines and do not reduce the dose, even if your asthma seems better, unless you or your child are told to do so by your doctor.

Talk to your doctor or get medical care right away if:

Montelukast may cause some people to be agitated, disoriented, irritable, or display other abnormal behaviors. It may also cause some people to have suicidal thoughts and tendencies or to become more depressed. Report any unusual thoughts or behaviors that trouble you or your child, especially if they are new or get worse quickly. Make sure the doctor knows if you or your child have trouble sleeping, get upset easily, or start to act reckless. Also tell the doctor if you or your child have sudden or strong feelings, such as feeling nervous, angry, restless, violent, or scared.
