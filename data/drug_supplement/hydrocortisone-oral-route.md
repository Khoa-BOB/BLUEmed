Check with your doctor right away if you have darkening of the skin, diarrhea, dizziness, fainting, joint pain, loss of appetite, mental depression, nausea, skin rash, unusual tiredness or weakness, or vomiting.

This medicine may increase the risk of hyperosmolarity (imbalance of salts and other substances in your blood leading to fluid shifts), metabolic acidosis (too much acid in the blood), and stomach problems. Check with your doctor right away if you have confusion, diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness, fast heartbeat, high blood pressure, irritability, muscle tremors or twitching, nausea, restlessness, seizures, stomach cramps, swelling of the feet or lower legs, unusual tiredness or weakness, or vomiting.

Using too much of this medicine or using it for a long time may increase your risk of having adrenal gland problems (eg, Cushing's syndrome). Talk to your doctor right away if you have blurred vision, dizziness or fainting, a fast, irregular, or pounding heartbeat, increased thirst or urination, irritability, or unusual tiredness or weakness.

If you are using this medicine for a long time, tell your doctor about any extra stress or anxiety in your life, including other health concerns and emotional stress. Your dose of this medicine might need to be changed for a short time while you have extra stress.

This medicine may cause you to get more infections than usual. Avoid people who are sick or have infections and wash your hands often. If you are exposed to chickenpox or measles, tell your doctor right away. If you start to have a fever, chills, sore throat, or any other sign of an infection, call your doctor right away.

Check with your doctor right away if blurred vision, difficulty in reading, eye pain, or any other change in vision occurs during or after treatment. These may be symptoms of eye or vision problems (eg, cataracts, glaucoma, central serous chorioretinopathy). Your doctor may want you to have your eyes checked by an ophthalmologist (eye doctor).

Some examples of live vaccines include measles, mumps, influenza (nasal flu vaccine), poliovirus (oral form), rotavirus, and rubella. If you have questions about this, talk to your doctor.

This medicine may cause changes in mood or behavior for some patients. Tell your doctor right away if you have depression, mood swings, a false or unusual sense of well-being, trouble with sleeping, or personality changes while taking this medicine.

This medicine may cause a serious type of reaction called tumor lysis syndrome.
