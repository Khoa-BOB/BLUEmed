## Description

Hydrocodone and ibuprofen combination is used to relieve short-term pain severe enough to require opioid treatment and when other pain medicines did not work well enough or cannot be tolerated. This medicine should only be used for short periods of time, usually for a total of less than 10 days. This combination is not used for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.

Hydrocodone is an opioid analgesic that acts on the central nervous system to relieve pain. If hydrocodone is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming (causing mental or physical dependence). However, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using opioids to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is less likely to occur when opioids are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal symptoms when you stop taking the medicine. Since hydrocodone and ibuprofen combination is only used for short-term (10 days or less) relief of pain, physical dependence will probably not occur.

Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used in this combination to relieve inflammation, swelling, and pain.

This medicine is available only under a restricted distribution program called the Opioid Analgesic REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet

Emergency medical attention is still needed after naloxone is used because the reversal effects are only temporary. Signs of an overdose include : trouble breathing, irregular, fast or slow, or shallow breathing, nausea or vomiting, pain in the upper stomach, pale or blue lips, fingernails, or skin, pinpoint pupils of the eyes, or yellow eyes or skin.

Do not use this medicine and an MAO inhibitor (eg, isocarboxazid [Marplan®], linezolid [Zyvox®], phenelzine [Nardil®], selegiline [Eldepryl®], tranylcypromine [Parnate®]) within 14 days of each other.
