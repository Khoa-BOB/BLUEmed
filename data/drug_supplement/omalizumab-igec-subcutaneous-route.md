# Omalizumab-igec (subcutaneous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Omlyclo

## Description

Omalizumab-igec injection is used to treat moderate to severe persistent allergic asthma. It is used when a patient's asthma has not been controlled sufficiently on other asthma medicines (eg, inhaled corticosteroids). This medicine will not relieve an asthma attack that has already started. Your doctor will perform a skin or blood test to check if you have allergies to year-round allergens.

Omalizumab-igec injection is also used to treat chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) in patients who have tried other medicines (eg, nasal corticosteroids) but they did not work well enough.

Omalizumab-igec injection is also used to treat food allergy. It is used to reduce allergic reactions that may occur after accidentally eating one or more foods to which you are allergic.

Omalizumab-igec injection is also used to treat chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) in patients who continue to have hives that are not controlled by an antihistamine (allergy medicine).

Omalizumab-igec is a medicine called an IgE blocker. IgE is short for immunoglobulin E, a substance that occurs naturally in the body in small amounts. This substance plays an important role in allergic asthma. When people with allergic asthma breathe in a year-round allergen, such as cat or dog dander, their bodies make more IgE. This may cause a series of reactions in your body that can lead to asthma attacks and symptoms. Omalizumab-igec works by helping to block IgE.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Solution
