Check with your doctor right away if you are having confusion, difficulty in speaking, slow speech, inability to speak or move the arms, legs, or facial muscles, double vision, or headache.

Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have difficulty with breathing, fast heartbeat, high fever, high or low blood pressure, increased sweating, loss of bladder control, seizures, severe muscle stiffness, unusually pale skin, or tiredness. These could be symptoms of a serious condition called neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).

Call your doctor right away if you or your child have any symptoms of heart rhythm problems, such as dizziness, feeling faint, or a fast, pounding, or irregular heartbeat.

Paliperidone can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. If you can, avoid people with infections.

Also, use extra care not to become too cold while you are using paliperidone. If you become too cold, you may feel drowsy, confused, or clumsy.
