## Description

Respiratory syncytial virus vaccine is an active immunizing agent used to prevent lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in adults 60 years of age and older. It is also given at 32 to 36 weeks of pregnancy to prevent LRTD and severe LRTD caused by RSV in infants from birth to 6 months of age. This vaccine is also used to prevent LRTD caused by RSV in patients 18 to 59 years of age who are at high risk for LRTD caused by RSV. It works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease.

Respiratory syncytial virus can cause serious breathing problems that may require hospitalization.

This vaccine is to be given only by or under the supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Powder for Solution

For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.
