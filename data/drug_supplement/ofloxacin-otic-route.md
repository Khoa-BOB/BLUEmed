## Proper Use

Ofloxacin eardrops comes with patient information and instructions (Medication Guide). Be sure to read these instructions before using the eardrops . If you have any questions, check with your doctor or health care professional.

To use:

- Hold the bottle in your hands for 1 or 2 minutes to warm up the solution before putting it in your ear. Otherwise, putting cold solution in your ear could cause you to become dizzy.
- Wash your hands with soap and water.
- Gently clean any discharge that can be removed easily from the outer ear, but do not insert any object or swab into the ear canal.
- If you are using the eardrops for a middle ear infection—Drop the medicine into the ear canal. Then, gently press the tragus of the ear (see the diagram in the Medication Guide) four times in a pumping motion. This will allow the drops to pass through the hole or tube in the eardrum and into the middle ear.
- If you are using the eardrops for an ear canal infection—Gently pull the outer ear up and back for adults (down and back for children) to straighten the ear canal. This will allow the eardrops to flow down into the ear canal.
- Keep the ear facing up for about 5 minutes to allow the medicine to come into contact with the infection.
- If both ears are being treated, turn over after 5 minutes, and repeat the application for the other ear.
- To keep the medicine as germ-free as possible, do not touch the applicator tip to any surface (including the ear). Also, keep the container tightly closed.
