## Proper Use

A doctor or other trained health professional will give you this medicine in a medical facility. It is given through a needle placed into one of your veins. The medicine must be given slowly, so the needle will have to remain in place for at least 2 hours.

This medicine should come with a Medication Guide. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have questions.

You may also receive other medicines (eg, allergy medicine, fever medicine, steroids) to help prevent possible unwanted effects from the injection.

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

Infliximab-abda may cause an infusion reaction while you are receiving it or right after the infusion ends. Check with your doctor or nurse right away if you have chest pain, a fever, chills, itching, hives, a rash, dizziness, fainting, lightheadedness, a headache, joint pain, difficulty with swallowing, trouble breathing, or swelling of the face, tongue, and throat.

This medicine may increase your risk for stroke, heart attack, low or high blood pressure, or heart rhythm problems during and within 24 hours of infusion. It may also cause temporary vision loss during or within 2 hours of infusion. Check with your doctor right away if you have confusion, difficulty in speaking, slow speech, inability to speak, inability to move your arms, legs, or facial muscles, double vision headache, blurred vision, dizziness, pounding in the ears, fainting, or a fast, slow, or irregular heartbeat during or after receiving the medicine.

Your body's ability to fight an infection may be reduced while you are receiving infliximab-abda. It is very important that you call your doctor at the first sign of any infection. Check with your doctor right away if you have a fever, chills, cough, flu-like symptoms, or unusual tiredness or weakness.

Serious skin reactions can occur while you are receiving this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you have blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, chills, cough, diarrhea, fever, itching, joint or muscle pain, red skin lesions, sore throat, sores, ulcers, or white spots in your mouth, or unusual tiredness or weakness.

This medicine may increase your chance of having a lupus-like syndrome or a liver disease called autoimmune hepatitis. Check with your doctor right away if you have dark brown-colored urine, fever or chills, a general feeling of discomfort, illness, or weakness, joint pain, light-colored stools, nausea and vomiting, a rash on the cheeks or arms that is worse in the sun, severe tiredness, upper right-sided stomach pain, or yellow eyes and skin.

A small number of people (including children and teenagers) who have used this medicine have developed certain types of cancer. This is more common in patients who have lung diseases (eg, emphysema, COPD) or are heavy smokers, and in psoriasis patients who have had phototherapy treatment for a long time. Phototherapy treatment is ultraviolet light or sunlight combined with oral medicine to make your skin sensitive to light. Some teenagers and young adults with Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis also developed a rare type of cancer called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. Talk with your doctor if you have unusual bleeding, bruising, or weakness, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, underarms, or groin, unexplained weight loss, or red, scaly patches, or raised bumps with pus on the skin.

Receiving this medicine may increase your risk of getting skin cancer (eg, melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma) or cervical cancer. If you have any changes or growths on your skin or if you have abnormal vaginal bleeding, pain in your pelvis, or frequent or painful urination, tell your doctor right away.

While you are being treated with infliximab-abda, do not have any immunizations (vaccines) without your doctor's approval. Live virus vaccines should not be given with infliximab-abda . Your child's vaccinations must be current before receiving infliximab-abda. Talk to your child's doctor if you have any questions about this.

If you have a baby while receiving infliximab-abda, make sure the baby's doctor knows that you were receiving this medicine. You will need to wait a few months before giving certain vaccines to your baby. Talk to the baby's doctor if you have questions.

You will need to have a skin test for tuberculosis before you start receiving this medicine. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your home has ever had a positive reaction to a tuberculosis skin test.

It is important to have your heart checked closely while you are receiving infliximab-abda, because this medicine may cause new or worsening heart failure. Call your doctor right away if you have trouble with breathing, swelling in the ankles and feet, or a sudden weight gain.

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes abatacept (Orencia®), anakinra (Kineret®), tocilizumab (Actemra®), or other medicines called biologics that are used to treat the same conditions as infliximab-abda. Using these medicines together with infliximab-abda may increase your chance of having serious unwanted effects .
