# Meningococcal vaccine group b (intramuscular route)

## Description

Meningococcal vaccine is an active immunizing agent used to prevent infection caused by certain groups (A, B, C, W, and Y) of meningococcal bacteria ( Neisseria meningitidis ). The vaccine works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease.

Meningococcal infection can cause life-threatening illnesses, including meningococcal meningitis, which affects the brain, and meningococcemia, which affects the blood. These diseases are more likely to occur in young children and in persons with certain diseases or conditions that make them more susceptible to a meningococcal infection or more likely to develop serious problems from a meningococcal infection.

Immunization against meningococcal disease is recommended for persons who are at risk of getting the disease because:

- They have certain diseases or conditions that make them more susceptible to a meningococcal infection or more likely to develop serious problems from a meningococcal infection.
- They are living in, working in, or visiting an area where there is a strong possibility of contracting meningococcal disease.

This vaccine is recommended for use in patients 10 to 25 years of age.

This vaccine is to be given only by or under the supervision of your doctor.
