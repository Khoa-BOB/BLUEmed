# Bosentan (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Tracleer

## Description

Bosentan is used to treat the symptoms of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adults or in children 3 years of age or older. It improves the ability to exercise and slows down the worsening of the patient's physical condition.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension is the high blood pressure that occurs in the main artery. This artery carries blood from the right side of the heart (the ventricle) to the lungs. When the smaller blood vessels in the lungs become more resistant to blood flow, the right ventricle must work harder to pump enough blood through the lungs. Bosentan works by blocking large quantities of the hormone normally found in the blood and lungs in people with pulmonary arterial hypertension. It also helps by increasing the supply of blood to the lungs and reducing the workload of the heart.

This medicine is available only under a special restricted distribution program called the Tracleer REMS (risk evaluation and mitigation strategy) Program.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet for Suspension
- Tablet
