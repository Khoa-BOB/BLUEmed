# Dupilumab (subcutaneous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Dupixent

## Description

Dupilumab injection is used alone or in combination with other medicines (eg, topical corticosteroids) to treat moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in patients who have been treated with topical medicines that did not work well or who cannot use topical treatment.

Dupilumab injection is also used together with other medicines to treat moderate to severe asthma in patients whose asthma is hard to control or who are dependent on steroid medicines. Dupilumab helps prevent severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) and can improve your breathing. This medicine will not relieve an asthma attack that has already started.

Dupilumab injection is also used as additional treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) that is not well controlled. This medicine is also used to treat eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and prurigo nodularis (PN).

Dupilumab injection is also used as additional treatment for inadequately controlled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a high number of blood eosinophils (a type of white blood cell that may contribute to COPD). This medicine is used to reduce the number of COPD flare-ups and helps improve breathing.

Dupilumab injection is also used to treat chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in patients who continue to have hives that are not controlled by an antihistamine (allergy medicine). This medicine is also used to treat bullous pemphigoid (BP).

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:
