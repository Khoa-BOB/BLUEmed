## Description

Naltrexone injection is used to help patients with opioid use disorder who have stopped taking opioids to stay drug-free and maintain their recovery. It is also used to help patients with alcohol use disorder stay alcohol-free. The medicine is not a cure for addiction. It is used as part of an overall program that may include counseling, attending support group meetings, and other treatment recommended by your healthcare provider.

Naltrexone is not an opioid. It works by blocking the effects of opioids, especially the euphoric and rewarding feeling that makes you want to use them. It also may block the euphoric and rewarding feeling that may make you want to use alcohol. It will not produce any opioid-like effects or cause mental or physical dependence. It will not prevent you from becoming impaired while drinking alcohol or using opioids.

Naltrexone will cause withdrawal symptoms in people who are no longer taking opioids for a period of time. Therefore, naltrexone treatment is started after you are no longer taking opioids for a period of time. The length of time this takes may depend on which opioid you took, the amount you took, and how long you took it. Before you start using this medicine, be sure to tell your healthcare provider if you think you are still having withdrawal symptoms.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your healthcare provider.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

Do not try to overcome the effects of naltrexone injection by taking opioids . You may be more sensitive to the effects of opioids than you were before beginning naltrexone treatment.
