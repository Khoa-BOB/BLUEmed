# Nelarabine (intravenous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Arranon

## Description

Nelarabine injection is used to treat specific types of cancer called T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL). This medicine is usually given to patients who have already received at least two other cancer medicines.

Nelarabine belongs to the group of medicines called antineoplastics. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by nelarabine, other effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Other effects may not be serious, but may cause concern.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Solution

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of nelarabine injection in children 1 year of age and older. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 1 year of age.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of nelarabine injection in the elderly.

## Proper Use

Medicines used to treat cancer are very strong and can have many side effects. Before receiving this medicine, make sure you understand all the risks and benefits. It is important for you to work closely with your doctor during your treatment.

A doctor or other trained health professional will give you or your child this medicine in a hospital or cancer treatment center. It is given through an IV catheter that is placed into one of your veins. This medicine must be given slowly, so the IV will have to stay in place for at least 1 to 2 hours.

This medicine should come with a patient information leaflet. Read it carefully and make sure you understand it before receiving this medicine. If you have any questions, ask your doctor.

Your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids so that you will pass more urine. Your doctor may also give medicine to decrease uric acid in the blood (eg, allopurinol). This will help prevent kidney problems and keep your kidneys working well.

Nelarabine sometimes causes nausea and vomiting. However, it is very important that you continue to receive the medicine , even if you begin to feel ill. Ask your doctor for ways to lessen these effects if they bother you.

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

Receiving this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. If you can get pregnant, your doctor may do tests to make sure you are not pregnant before receiving this medicine. Use an effective form of birth control during treatment to keep from getting pregnant. Male patients with female partners should use an effective form of birth control during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose. If you think you have become pregnant while receiving the medicine, tell your doctor right away.

Nelarabine can cause serious nervous system problems. This may be more likely in patients who have had cancer treatment or radiation treatment to the head or back in the past. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have a headache, dizziness, numbness and tingling in the hands, fingers, feet, or toes, extreme sleepiness, seizures, clumsiness or unsteadiness while walking, or weakness in the arms, hands, legs, or feet.

While you are being treated with nelarabine, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccinations) without your doctor's approval . Nelarabine may lower your body's resistance and there is a chance you or your child might get the infection the vaccination is meant to prevent. In addition, other persons living in your household should not take oral polio vaccine since there is a chance they could pass the polio virus on to you. Also, avoid persons who have taken oral polio vaccine within the last several months. Do not get close to them, and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you cannot take these precautions, you should consider wearing a protective face mask that covers the nose and mouth.

Nelarabine can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:

- If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.
- Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.
- Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.
- Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.
- Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.
- Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.

This medicine may cause a serious reaction called tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Call your doctor right away if you or your child have a change in how much or how often you urinate, rapid weight gain, muscle or joint pain, swelling of the feet or lower legs, or feel tired.

This medicine may cause some people to become dizzy, lightheaded, drowsy, or less alert than they are normally. If any of these side effects occur, do not drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy or are not alert while you are using nelarabine.

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
