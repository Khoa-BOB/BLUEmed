## Description

Estradiol vaginal gel , insert , and ring are used to treat changes in and around the vagina (such as vaginal dryness, itching, and burning) caused by low estrogen levels or menopause.

The hormone from the vaginal gel or ring is absorbed through your vagina. It works by preventing symptoms, such as feelings of warmth in the face, neck, and chest, or sudden strong feelings of heat and sweating (hot flashes) in women during menopause.

Estradiol vaginal insert is also used to treat moderate to severe painful sexual intercourse caused by menopause.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

- Do not remove the ring from the sealed pouch until you are ready to use it.

- You will leave the ring inside for 90 days (3 months), unless your doctor tells you a different schedule. After that time, remove the ring and insert a new one. If you forget to remove the ring after 90 days, call your doctor for instructions.
- The ring may move down into the lower part of your vagina accidently. This can happen if you strain to have a bowel movement. Use your finger to gently push the ring back into place.
