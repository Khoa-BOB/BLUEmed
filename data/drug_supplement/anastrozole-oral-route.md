# Anastrozole (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Arimidex

## Description

Anastrozole is used to treat early hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. It is also used for first-line treatment of hormone receptor-positive or hormone receptor-unknown advanced or metastatic (cancer that has spread) breast cancer. Anastrozole is also used to treat advanced breast cancer that has grown or spread after tamoxifen treatment. This medicine is used only in women who have already stopped menstruating (postmenopausal).

Many breast cancer tumors grow in response to estrogen. This medicine interferes with the production of estrogen in the body. As a result, the amount of estrogen that the tumor is exposed to is reduced, limiting the growth of the tumor.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
