# Buprenorphine (intradermal route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Probuphine

## Description

Buprenorphine implant is used for the maintenance treatment of opioid (narcotic) dependence in patients who have received other medicines containing buprenorphine (eg, Suboxone®, Subutex®).

When a narcotic medicine is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if the narcotic is stopped suddenly. Severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented when a person is switched to buprenorphine. It acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to help prevent the withdrawal side effects.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a trained healthcare professional.

## Before Using

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of buprenorphine implant in children younger than 16 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

Your doctor will treat the arm with numbing medicine and then cut a small incision to insert the implant with a special tool. The incision will be covered with 2 bandages. The top adhesive bandage will be placed over the arm and should be left on for 24 hours. Keep the smaller, bottom bandage clean and dry and in place for 3 to 5 days.

You should apply an ice pack to your arm for 40 minutes every 2 hours for the first 24 hours after placing the implants or as needed.

Your doctor will give you a patient identification card to carry with you.
