# Rivastigmine (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Exelon

## Description

Rivastigmine is used to treat mild to moderate dementia (memory loss and mental changes) associated with Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease. Rivastigmine will not cure or stop Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease from getting worse, however, rivastigmine can improve the thinking ability in some patients.

In Alzheimer's disease, many chemical changes take place in the brain. One of the earliest and biggest changes is that there is less of a chemical called acetylcholine (ACh). ACh helps the brain to work properly. Rivastigmine slows the breakdown of ACh, so it can build up and have a greater effect. However, as Alzheimer's disease gets worse, there will be less and less ACh, so rivastigmine may not work as well.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Capsule
