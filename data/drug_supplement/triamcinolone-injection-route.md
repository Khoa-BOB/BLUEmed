## Description

Triamcinolone injection provides relief for inflamed areas of the body. It is used to treat a number of different conditions, such as inflammation (swelling), severe allergies, adrenal problems, arthritis, blood or bone marrow problems, eye or vision problems, lung or breathing problems (eg, asthma), lupus, skin conditions, kidney problems, ulcerative colitis, and flare-ups of multiple sclerosis. Triamcinolone is a corticosteroid (cortisone-like medicine or steroid). It works on the immune system to help relieve swelling, redness, itching, and allergic reactions.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Suspension
- Powder for Suspension, Extended Release

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of triamcinolone injection in the pediatric population. However, pediatric patients are more likely to have slower growth and bone problems if triamcinolone injection is used for a long time. Recommended doses should not be exceeded, and the patient should be carefully monitored during treatment.

Triamcinolone injection contains benzyl alcohol, which may cause serious unwanted effects in premature infants.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of triamcinolone injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of this medicine than younger adults and are more likely to have liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for elderly patients receiving triamcinolone injection.

## Precautions

It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress at regular visits to make sure this medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to receive it. Blood or urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

This medicine contains benzyl alcohol which may cause serious reactions (eg, gasping syndrome, low blood pressure, and metabolic acidosis) to newborn or premature infants. Discuss this with your doctor if you are concerned.

This medicine may cause a serious allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are receiving this medicine.

If you will be receiving this medicine for a long time, tell your doctor about any extra stress or anxiety in your life, including other health concerns and emotional stress. Your dose of this medicine might need to be changed for a short time while you have extra stress.

This medicine may cause fluid retention (edema) in some patients. Carefully follow your doctor's instructions about any special diet (especially on salt intake).

Using too much of this medicine or using it for a long time may increase your risk of having adrenal gland problems. Talk to your doctor right away if you or your child have blurred vision, dizziness or fainting, a fast, irregular, or pounding heartbeat, increased thirst or urination, irritability, or unusual tiredness or weakness.

This medicine may cause you or your child to get more infections than usual. Avoid people who are sick or have infections and wash your hands often. If you or your child are exposed to chickenpox or measles, tell your doctor right away. If you or your child start to have a fever, chills, sore throat, or any other sign of an infection, call your doctor right away.

Tell your doctor if you or your child have recently spent time in a tropical climate or have unexplained diarrhea before receiving this medicine.

While you are being treated with triamcinolone injection, do not have any immunizations (vaccines) without your doctor's approval . Triamcinolone may lower your body's resistance and the vaccine may not work as well or you might get the infection the vaccine is meant to prevent. In addition, you should not be around other persons living in your household who receive live virus vaccines because there is a chance they could pass the virus on to you. Some examples of live vaccines include measles, mumps, influenza (nasal flu vaccine), poliovirus (oral form), rotavirus, and rubella. If you have questions about this, talk to your doctor.

Check with your doctor immediately if blurred vision, difficulty in reading, or any other change in vision occurs during or after treatment. Your doctor may want you or your child to have your eyes checked by an ophthalmologist (eye doctor).

This medicine may increase your risk for cancer, including Kaposi's sarcoma. Tell your doctor right away if you have flat, painless spots that are red or purple on white skin or bluish, brownish, or black on dark skin.

Before you have any skin tests, tell the medical doctor in charge that you are taking this medicine. The results of some tests may be affected by this medicine.

Do not stop receiving this medicine suddenly without checking first with your doctor . Your doctor may want you or your child to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely.

This medicine might cause thinning of the bones (osteoporosis) or slow growth in children if received for a long time. Tell your doctor if you have any bone pain or if you have an increased risk for osteoporosis. If your child is receiving this medicine, tell the doctor if you think your child is not growing properly.

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
