# Mitomycin (injection route, urinary bladder route)

## Brand Name

### Canadian Brand Name

mitoMYcin

Mutamycin

## Description

Mitomycin injection is used to treat low-grade upper tract urothelial cancer (LG-UTUC). LG-UTUC is a type of cancer of the lining of the upper urinary tract (eg, lining of the kidney).

Mitomycin injection is also used to treat low-grade intermediate risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (LG-IR-NMIBC) in patients who have received bladder surgery to remove tumor but did not work well or is no longer working.

Mitomycin interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are then destroyed by the body.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.

Mitomycin can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:

- If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.
- Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.
- Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.
- Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.
- Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.
- Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.

Mitomycin may cause your urine to change to a violet to blue color. It is recommended to do the following after receiving this medicine:

- Avoid skin contact with urine for at least 6 hours for Jelmyto™ and 24 hours for Zusduri™.
- Male and female patients should sit on the toilet when urinating and flush it several times after using.
- Wash your hands, inner thighs, and genital area well with soap and water after going to the bathroom.
- Wash the clothing soiled with urine right away and separately from any other clothing.

Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
