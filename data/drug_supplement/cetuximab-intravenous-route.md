## Description

Cetuximab injection is used together with radiation treatment for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), or with a platinum-based cancer medicine with fluorouracil to treat SCCHN that has come back (recurrent) or has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic). Cetuximab injection is also used alone in patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN who have received other medicines that did not work well.

Cetuximab injection is used together with other medicines (eg, irinotecan, fluorouracil, leucovorin) to treat K-Ras wild-type, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-expressing, metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC, cancer of the colon and rectum that has spread). Your doctor will test for the presence of this gene mutation. Cetuximab injection is also used alone to treat patients with mCRC who have received other medicines (eg, irinotecan, oxaliplatin) that did not work well.

Cetuximab injection is also used together with encorafenib to treat metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC, cancer of the colon and rectum that has spread) and have the BRAF V600E mutations. Your doctor will use a special test to look for these mutations.

Cetuximab interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are then destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by cetuximab, other effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Other effects, such as a skin rash, may not be serious but may cause concern. Some effects do not occur until months or years after the medicine is used.

This medicine should only be given by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.
