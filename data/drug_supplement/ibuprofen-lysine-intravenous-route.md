# Ibuprofen lysine (intravenous route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Neoprofen

## Description

Ibuprofen lysine is used to treat patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in premature babies (babies born too early) weighing between 500 to 1500 grams (g), who are born not more than 32 weeks of pregnancy when usual medical management is not effective. PDA is a heart disease where a blood vessel, the ductus arteriosus, fails to close normally after birth. This blood vessel is only used before birth, and is no longer needed after the baby is born. Ibuprofen lysine works by causing the PDA to constrict, and this closes the blood vessel.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the supervision of your doctor.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Solution
