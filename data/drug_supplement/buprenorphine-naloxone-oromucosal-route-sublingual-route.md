## Description

Buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablet is used to treat opioid (narcotic) dependence or addiction. Buprenorphine and naloxone buccal film , sublingual film , or sublingual tablet is used for induction and maintenance treatment of opioid (narcotic) dependence. It should be used in patients who have already been treated with buprenorphine sublingual tablets.

When a narcotic medicine is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if the narcotic is stopped suddenly. Severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented when a person is switched to buprenorphine and naloxone combination. It acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to help prevent the withdrawal side effects.

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

This product is available in the following dosage forms:

- Tablet
- Film

## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals.
