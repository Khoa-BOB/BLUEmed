# Raloxifene (oral route)

## Brand Name

### US Brand Name

Evista

## Description

Raloxifene is used to help prevent and treat thinning of the bones (osteoporosis) only in postmenopausal women.

It works like an estrogen to stop the bone loss that can develop in women after menopause, but it does not increase the bone density as much as daily 0.625 mg doses of conjugated estrogens. Raloxifene will not treat hot flashes of menopause and may cause hot flashes to occur. Also, raloxifene does not stimulate the breast or uterus as estrogen does.

Raloxifene lowers the blood concentrations of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, the bad cholesterols, but it does not increase concentrations of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the good cholesterol, in your blood.

Raloxifene is also used to lower chances of having invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis or at high risk of having invasive breast cancer .

This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
