## Before Using

In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

### Allergies

Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.

### Pediatric

Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of metronidazole capsules , oral liquid , and tablets in the pediatric population, except for the treatment of amebiasis. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of metronidazole extended-release tablets to treat bacterial vaginosis in teenage females, but should not be used before the start of menstruation.

### Geriatric

Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of metronidazole in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have unwanted effects and age-related liver problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving metronidazole.

## Precautions

It is important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that the infection is cleared up. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.

If your symptoms do not improve within a few days after you start this medicine or if they become worse, check with your doctor.

Do not take metronidazole if you have taken disulfiram (Antabuse®) within the last 2 weeks. Using these medicines together may cause serious unwanted effects .

Drinking alcoholic beverages while using this medicine may cause stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, headache, or flushing or redness of the face. Other alcohol-containing preparations (eg, elixirs, cough syrups, tonics) may also cause problems. These problems may last for at least one day after you stop using metronidazole. This medicine may also cause alcoholic beverages to taste different. You should not drink alcoholic beverages or take other alcohol-containing preparations while you are using this medicine and for at least 3 days after stopping it .

If you have trichomoniasis : Using this medicine while you are pregnant (especially during the first 3 months of pregnancy) can harm your unborn baby. Use an effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant. If you think you have become pregnant while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away.

If you are using this medicine for trichomoniasis (an infection of the sex organs), your doctor may want to treat your sexual partner at the same time you are being treated, even if he or she has no symptoms. Also, it may be desirable to use a condom during sexual intercourse. These measures will help to keep you from getting the infection back again from your partner. If you have any questions about this, talk with your doctor.

Check with your doctor right away if you have burning, numbness, tingling, or painful sensations in the arms, hands, legs, or feet. These could be symptoms of a condition called peripheral neuropathy.

Check with your doctor right away if you have dizziness, problems with muscle control or coordination, shakiness or an unsteady walk, slurred speech, or trouble speaking. These may be symptoms of a serious brain condition called encephalopathy.

Call your doctor right away if you have confusion, drowsiness, fever, a general feeling of illness, a headache, loss of appetite, nausea, a stiff neck or back, or vomiting. These could be symptoms of a serious condition called aseptic meningitis.

This medicine may increase your risk of having serious liver problems, which may be life-threatening. This is more likely if you have Cockayne syndrome (rare form of dwarfism). Check with your doctor right away if you have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, or yellow eyes or skin.

Metronidazole may cause dry mouth, an unpleasant or sharp metallic taste, and a change in taste sensation. For temporary relief of dry mouth, use sugarless candy or gum, melt bits of ice in your mouth, or use a saliva substitute. If your mouth continues to feel dry for more than 2 weeks, check with your medical doctor or dentist. Continuing dryness of the mouth may increase the chance of dental disease, including tooth decay, gum disease, and fungus infections.
