## Description

Lenacapavir injection is used together with other medicines to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in patients who have previously received other HIV medicines, have HIV that is resistant to several HIV medicines, and are currently using HIV medicines that are failing (eg, medicines are not working or no longer work, you cannot tolerate the side effects, or you cannot take because of safety reasons). HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).

This medicine will not cure HIV infection or AIDS. It works by lowering the amount of HIV in the blood and helps the immune system. This may help delay some of the medical conditions that usually result from AIDS or HIV disease.

This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.
